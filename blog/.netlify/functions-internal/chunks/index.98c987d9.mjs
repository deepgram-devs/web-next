Now, I didn\u2019t get to participate, but I was able to answer questions, cheer on our participants, and read all of the posts. And what I learned is that there are some really inspiring people out there. One of my favorite parts of the hackathon was reading through all the posts and seeing the positive comments and interactions. It was hard to choose the top projects or posts in many cases, but you can find the [full list of winners here](https://dev.to/devteam/congrats-to-the-deepgram-hackathon-winners-586i). What stood out among these participants and the others we ranked high on our list? How can you make your hackathon submission stand out in future hackathons? That's what we're talking about today. Let's explore five ways to make your hackathon submission stand out.\r\n\r\n## Grab the Reader\u2019s Attention\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re submitting to a hackathon, you want to stand out. The quickest way to do that is to grab the reader's attention. This could be through the project's topic, usefulness, or playfulness. By pulling the reader in early in your submission, you\u2019ve hooked them into reading more and invited them to go on the journey with you.\r\n\r\n## Don\u2019t Shy Away from Storytelling with Your Hackathon Submission\r\n\r\nYou might remember from my [Technical Writing: A Developer\u2019s Guide to Storytelling](https://blog.deepgram.com/technical-writing-a-developers-guide-to-storytelling/) that storytelling connects you to the reader on a more personal level. It takes it a step deeper than getting the reader\u2019s attention. How will you stay in the reader\u2019s memory? Think about what your reader needs--I wrote more about this in [Technical Writing: a Beginner\u2019s Guide](https://blog.deepgram.com/technical-writing-a-beginners-guide/) if you want to learn more. Can you help solve their problem? When they read through your blog, will they say, \u201CI could **really** use that!\u201D If they do, you\u2019ve pulled them into your story, and they\u2019ll remember you.\r\n\r\n## Create a Clear Purpose and Explain your Project Approach\r\n\r\nHackathons are ultimately about solving a problem. The reader should know what problem you\u2019re trying to solve. This is one of the reasons why writing a blog post along with your submissions can be helpful. You can clarify what you\u2019re doing, and why you\u2019re doing it and provide the reader with the context they need to understand your project.\r\n\r\n## Don\u2019t Underestimate Creativity when Using the Product\r\n\r\nEach of the winners gave a unique take on a problem that was solved or improved with Deepgram\u2019s Speech-to-Text Technology. If you read through all of our submissions, you\u2019ll notice that some projects overlapped or were trying to solve the same problem. How can you differentiate yourself from similar projects?\r\n\r\n## Include a Live Preview or Video Demo\r\n\r\nHaving a way for the reader to understand what your project does- whether through a live demo or a video recording- helps tell the story of the code you\u2019ve created. Although we did go through and run the code of other projects that ranked high on our list, seeing a project and interacting with it in some way helps grab the reader\u2019s attention and remember the project.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of benfits to entering hackathons beyond winning prizes. Entering hackathons is a great way to create a portfolio project, work on project-based learning, and see how others approach a problem.\r\n\r\nCongratulations to all of our participants. Thank you for sharing your stories and your projects with us. We took a lot of inspiration away from this event, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to learn from you and sharing what we\u2019ve learned.

Now, I didn’t get to participate, but I was able to answer questions, cheer on our participants, and read all of the posts. And what I learned is that there are some really inspiring people out there. One of my favorite parts of the hackathon was reading through all the posts and seeing the positive comments and interactions. It was hard to choose the top projects or posts in many cases, but you can find the <a href="https://dev.to/devteam/congrats-to-the-deepgram-hackathon-winners-586i">full list of winners here</a>. What stood out among these participants and the others we ranked high on our list? How can you make your hackathon submission stand out in future hackathons? That’s what we’re talking about today. Let’s explore five ways to make your hackathon submission stand out.</p>
<h2 id="grab-the-readers-attention">Grab the Reader’s Attention</h2>
<p>When you’re submitting to a hackathon, you want to stand out. The quickest way to do that is to grab the reader’s attention. This could be through the project’s topic, usefulness, or playfulness. By pulling the reader in early in your submission, you’ve hooked them into reading more and invited them to go on the journey with you.</p>
<h2 id="dont-shy-away-from-storytelling-with-your-hackathon-submission">Don’t Shy Away from Storytelling with Your Hackathon Submission</h2>
<p>You might remember from my <a href="https://blog.deepgram.com/technical-writing-a-developers-guide-to-storytelling/">Technical Writing: A Developer’s Guide to Storytelling</a> that storytelling connects you to the reader on a more personal level. It takes it a step deeper than getting the reader’s attention. How will you stay in the reader’s memory? Think about what your reader needs—I wrote more about this in <a href="https://blog.deepgram.com/technical-writing-a-beginners-guide/">Technical Writing: a Beginner’s Guide</a> if you want to learn more. Can you help solve their problem? When they read through your blog, will they say, “I could <strong>really</strong> use that!” If they do, you’ve pulled them into your story, and they’ll remember you.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-clear-purpose-and-explain-your-project-approach">Create a Clear Purpose and Explain your Project Approach</h2>
<p>Hackathons are ultimately about solving a problem. The reader should know what problem you’re trying to solve. This is one of the reasons why writing a blog post along with your submissions can be helpful. You can clarify what you’re doing, and why you’re doing it and provide the reader with the context they need to understand your project.</p>
<h2 id="dont-underestimate-creativity-when-using-the-product">Don’t Underestimate Creativity when Using the Product</h2>
<p>Each of the winners gave a unique take on a problem that was solved or improved with Deepgram’s Speech-to-Text Technology. If you read through all of our submissions, you’ll notice that some projects overlapped or were trying to solve the same problem. How can you differentiate yourself from similar projects?</p>
<h2 id="include-a-live-preview-or-video-demo">Include a Live Preview or Video Demo</h2>
<p>Having a way for the reader to understand what your project does- whether through a live demo or a video recording- helps tell the story of the code you’ve created. Although we did go through and run the code of other projects that ranked high on our list, seeing a project and interacting with it in some way helps grab the reader’s attention and remember the project.</p>
<p>There are a lot of benfits to entering hackathons beyond winning prizes. Entering hackathons is a great way to create a portfolio project, work on project-based learning, and see how others approach a problem.</p>
