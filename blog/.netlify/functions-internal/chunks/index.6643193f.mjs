<p>We have a variety of issues, but if you see something that you’d like to contribute, feel free to create an issue or ask a question on our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/categories/q-a">Community Forum</a>. We’re not the only ones using Deepgram in a Hacktoberfest project though! Check out some of our community members’ projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/drewclem/gramcstr">Gramcastr</a> from <a href="https://github.com/drewclem">@DrewClem</a> is a Next.js project that will use Deepgram to generate podcast transcripts and summarize the projects. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JesseRWeigel/voice-to-text-notes">Voice To Text Notes</a> from <a href="https://github.com/JesseRWeigel">@JesseRWeigel</a> is a basic speech to text app made with TypeScript that will add features like the ability to save text locally, edit text, and save text to a server. </li>
</ul>
<p>We’re super stoked to see what comes out of Hacktoberfest, and we have some fun events planned as well–check out our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/categories/events">Events Category</a> to see what Hacktoberfest events we have planned. </p>
<p>If you have an open source project you’d like to share–even if it doesn’t have anything to do with Deepgram-add it to <a href="https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/36">our Open Source Project discussion</a>, so we can amplify what you’re doing!</p>`;
