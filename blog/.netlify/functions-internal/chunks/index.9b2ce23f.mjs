The members of the Python community organize PyCon and welcome people of all developer experience levels. We at Deepgram are incredibly excited about PyCon US 2022 because we are one of the sponsors this year and have a booth. You might be wondering what\u2019s so special about having one? The best part about it is that we get to meet people like yourself, and you can interact with our technology!\n\n## What is Deepgram?\n\nDeepgram is an automated voice-to-text company that allows you to build applications that transcribe speech-to-text, where you\u2019ll receive an actual transcript of the person speaking or a conversation between multiple people. One of the many reasons to choose us over other providers is that we build better voice applications with faster, more accurate transcription through AI Speech Recognition.\n\nWe offer real-time transcription and pre-recorded speech-to-text, allowing you to upload a file with voice. We recently published a blog post on using our Python SDK to do live transcription with some of the most popular Python web frameworks, including [FastAPI](https://blog.deepgram.com/live-transcription-fastapi/), [Flask](https://blog.deepgram.com/live-transcription-flask/), [Django](https://blog.deepgram.com/live-transcription-django/), and [Quart](https://blog.deepgram.com/live-transcription-quart/).\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of Deepgram let\u2019s see how you can use us to change the world.\n\n## Deepgram Speech-to-Text Use Cases\n\nAt Deepgram, we live by our mission of \u201CWe believe every voice should be heard \u2013 and understood.\u201D We do this by making it easy for innovators to build scalable, more humanized voice experiences that could be game-changers or save lives.\n\nHere are some speech recognition use cases for Deepgram.\n\n### Medical Transcription Speech-to-Text\n\nImagine you have a loved one who needs medical attention. The physician usually takes notes by memory or types them into the computer when visiting the doctor. What if they could use the patient\u2019s voice to capture what\u2019s happening with them medically? The application can transcribe the real-time conversation between the doctor and patient. This feature will save lots of time which is crucial for saving a patient. You could also provide valuable insights from the speech recognition transcript that the doctor may have missed or look for important words or phrases the patient spoke using Deepgram\u2019s search feature. You can check out more information about this feature on our [API Reference page](https://developers.deepgram.com/api-reference/).\n\n### Police BodyCam Analysis Speech-to-Text\n\nIn today\u2019s world, there are police departments that have officers wearing body cameras. It records their interactions and behaviors using it as a training and safety tool. Using Deepgram\u2019s Python SDK speech-to-text features, you can capture the audio into a transcript that can provide insights into how a police officer interacts with the public. To de-escalate situations, they can receive feedback from their superiors.\n\nAnother scenario is a police captain can analyze a Deepgram transcript using speech recognition to determine the effectiveness of something, like a traffic stop. Essential phrases can be verified, decreasing the number of lawsuits for police departments.\n\n### Accessibility Speech-to-Text\n\nImagine you have a friend who has a disability who cannot use their hands to type and needs the help of customer service at their favorite store. With Deepgram, you can build an application that allows for Conversational AI, to hold a conversation with a chatbot instead of typing. Chatbots are increasing in popularity and sometimes the only way to reach customer service but limit a whole population segment.\n\nUsing Deepgram Python speech recognition can also increase educational opportunities for those who may have learning disabilities. Instead of writing an essay or paper, you can build an editor that allows people to write with their voice.\n\n## Visit Deepgram at PyCon\n\nYou\u2019ve now learned a handful of use cases for Deepgram voice-to-text transcription and Python. There are many more, and the opportunities are endless. Can you think of other uses cases for Deepgram and our Python SDK?
