Hi, I'm Brian. I am a Developer Experience Engineer here at Deepgram where I'll be helping build our developer education platform. My goal is to help developers in any way I can.\r
\r
I started my career in Supply Chain Management building spreadsheets to analyze purchasing decisions. I loved creating macros to build tools for my team to use in order to make a better informed decision. It was in building those spreadsheets that I learned the art of the Google search. After talking with some Frontend Developers at work one day I decided to look into learning to code and have loved it ever since.\r
\r
Early on in my learning process I helped establish a meetup for the local FreeCodeCamp group in Salt Lake City. Meeting with other people in the learning process and presenting on what I had been learning was instrumental in my personal growth. I eventually decided to jumpstart my learning by attending a coding bootcamp. After completing that and getting my first job as a professional developer I started meeting weekly with the local FreeCodeCamp study group to do what I could to help others in their learning process. I also have also helped organize the UtahJS conference the past few years.\r
\r
People often talk about being "passionate" about what you do for a living. I can honestly say that I am not passionate about programming. However, I love the opportunites that programming gives me. I absolutely love teaching people and helping them learn new things. I love that being a developer has given me the opportunity to solve problems in my day to day work and work with really smart and interesting people. So while I'm not passionate about development itself, I am passionate about the things it allows me to do.\r
\r
Outside of programming I have a lot of things keeping me busy. I love spending time with my wife and two kids. When I'm not spending time with them at any number of activities, I'm probably playing disc golf or watching it on YouTube. I was fortunate to be able to witness [the greatest shot in the sport's history this summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lpcB5PJBVo).\r
