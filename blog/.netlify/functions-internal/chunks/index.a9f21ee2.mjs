We've also risen to the number two spot in [Voice Recognition](https://blog.deepgram.com/what-is-asr/) Software on G2, based on reviews from our users. According to G2, **91% of Deepgram users think we're heading in the right direction,** and 89% of users said they'd be likely to recommend us to others looking for voice recognition solutions. So, why are we ranked so highly? Is it our speed, our accuracy, or our ease of use? Yes! But that's not the only reason our customers love us. Here's a sample of what some of our users had to say about using Deepgram in their G2 reviews:

* \u26A1\uFE0F  ["Powerful, accurate, scalable and blindingly fast!"](https://www.g2.com/products/deepgram/reviews/deepgram-review-5142053)
* \u{1F4AC}  ["The Deepgram API covers the languages we need (and then some)..."](https://www.g2.com/products/deepgram/reviews/deepgram-review-5143659)
* \u2705  ["Deepgram's accuracy is hands-down the best aspect of their service."](https://www.g2.com/products/deepgram/reviews/deepgram-review-5139446)

If you'd like to check out all of the reviews and discover even more reasons why our users love us so much-or leave your own review of Deepgram if you're already a fan-[take a look at our page on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/deepgram/reviews).
