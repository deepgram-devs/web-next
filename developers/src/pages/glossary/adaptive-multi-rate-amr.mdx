title: Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR)
description: Lossy audio coding algorithm specifically optimized for speech
  coding, which transmits both speech parameters and waveform signals. AMR
  dynamically adjusts speech bit rate and channel coding to adapt to various
  network conditions, maximizing the possibility of receiving audio signals. It
  also reduces bandwidth during periods of silence using technologies like
  discontinuous transmission (DTX), voice activity detection (VAD), and comfort
  noise generation (CNG). AMR is most frequently used in digital telephony (such
  as VoIP, Wi-Fi, and satellite telephony), multimedia-audio and
  videoconferencing, digital radio broadcasting, and audiobooks. It provides
  good quality speech at low cost and is available in both a narrowband version
  (speech bandwidth of 300-3400 Hz) and a wideband version (speech bandwidth of
  50-7000 Hz).
