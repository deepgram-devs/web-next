title: Mu-law
description: Lossy audio coding algorithm that reduces the dynamic range of an
  audio signal by removing data from the upper and lower frequencies that humans
  are generally unable to hear, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio
  without increasing the amount of data. Mu-law compresses audio data to 50% of
  its original size. Mu-law is primarily used as a telecommunication standard in
  North America and Japan.
