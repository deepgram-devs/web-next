title: Opus
description: Lossy audio coding algorithm designed to efficiently code speech
  and general audio in a single format, while remaining low-latency enough for
  real-time interactive communication and low-complexity enough for low-end
  embedded processors. Opus replaces both Vorbis and Speex for new applications,
  and several blind listening tests have ranked it higher quality than any other
  standard audio format at any given bitrate until transparency is reached,
  including MP3, AAC, and HE-AAC. Opus packets may be wrapped in a network
  packet that supplies the packet length. Optionally, a self-delimited packet
  format that adds one or two additional bytes per packet to encode the packet
  length may be used.
