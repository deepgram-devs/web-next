title: Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
description: Detection of the presence or absence of human speech, mainly used
  in speech coding and recognition. VAD can both facilitate speech processing
  and be used to deactivate processes during non-speech sections of audio,
  thereby saving computation effort and network bandwidth. Multiple VAD
  algorithms have been developed that provide varying features and compromises
  between latency, sensitivity, accuracy, and computational cost. Some VAD
  algorithms also provide further analysis, such as by identifying whether
  speech is voiced, unvoiced, or sustained.
