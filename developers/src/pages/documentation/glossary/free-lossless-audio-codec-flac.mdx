title: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
description: Lossless audio coding algorithm specifically designed for the
  efficient packing of audio data, which allow it to be streamed and decoded
  quickly, independent of compression level. FLAC can typically reduce audio
  data to between 50-70% of its original size, though the final size depends on
  the density and amplitude of the audio being compressed. Because it is
  lossless, FLAC is suitable as an archive method, as an exact duplication of
  the original data can be recovered at any time. FLAC is an open format with
  royalty-free licensing and supports metadata tagging, album cover art, and
  fast seeking.
