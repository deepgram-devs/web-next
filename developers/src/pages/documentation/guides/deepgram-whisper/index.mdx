Deepgram’s Whisper API gives you access to OpenAI’s Whisper model by way of the Deepgram API. Accessing the Whisper model through Deepgram provides many benefits. Some of these benefits include:

- Pairing the Whisper model with Deepgram features that you can’t get using the OpenAI speech-to-text API, such as diarization and word timings.
- Support for all Whisper model sizes: tiny, base, small, medium, and large.
- Scalable infrastructure that can handle high-traffic usage (up to 50 concurrent requests per minute).
- Support for audio files up to 2GB

In this guide, you’ll learn how to transcribe pre-recorded audio using Deepgram’s hosted Whisper API.

## Before You Begin

### Create a Deepgram Account

To use the Whisper API hosted by Deepgram, you’ll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes:

- $200 in credit, which gives you access to:
  - all base models
  - pre-recorded and streaming functionality
  - all features

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

## Quickstart

Transcribe a remote file using Deepgram's Whisper API with the following request.

<CodeGroup title="curl" default="curl" tabs={["curl"]}>

<CodeBlock tab="curl" active>

```sh
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/interview_speech-analytics.wav"}' \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper'

```

</CodeBlock>

</CodeGroup>

## Enable Whisper Model and Sizes

To enable Deepgram’s Whisper API, add a model parameter in the query string and set it to `model=whisper`

```bash
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper
```

To enable a specific size of the Whisper model, set the model parameter to `model=whisper-size`.

```bash
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper-SIZE
```

<Alert type="info">

If `model=whisper` is supplied and no model size specified, the model size will default to `model=whisper-medium`.
