<div class="badge">PRE-RECORDED</div>

Deepgram Whisper Cloud is a fully managed API that gives you access to Deepgram's version of OpenAI’s Whisper model.

<Alert type="info">Deepgram hosts and maintains these Whisper models; they aren't hosted or run by Open AI.</Alert>

Using Deepgram's fully hosted Whisper Cloud instead of running your own version provides many benefits. Some of these benefits include:

- Pairing the Whisper model with Deepgram features that you can’t get using the OpenAI speech-to-text API, such as diarization and word timings.
- Support for all Whisper model sizes: tiny, base, small, medium, and large.
- Scalable infrastructure that can handle high-traffic usage (up to 50 requests per minute or 15 concurrent requests).
- Support for audio files up to 2GB

In this guide, you’ll learn how to transcribe pre-recorded audio using Deepgram’s hosted Whisper API.

<Alert type="warning">

Live streaming is not available with Deepgram Whisper Cloud. If you would like to transcribe live streamed audio, we recommend using our Nova model. [This quickstart](/documentation/getting-started/streaming/) can help you get started.

</Alert>

## Before You Begin

### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and no credit card is required. Free access includes:

$200 in free credit (around 45,000 minutes) which gives you access to:

- all models
- pre-recorded and streaming functionality
- all features

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

## Quickstart

### Transcribe a Remote File

Transcribe a remote file using Deepgram's Whisper API with the following request.

<Alert type="info">

Data sent through API requests for our Whisper models will not be sent to OpenAI.

</Alert>

<CodeGroup title="curl" default="curl" tabs={["curl"]}>

<CodeBlock tab="curl" active>

```sh
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/interview_speech-analytics.wav"}' \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper'

```

</CodeBlock>

</CodeGroup>

### Analyze Response

<Alert type="warning">There is a 10 minute time out for all Deepgram models. Transcription requests that run longer than 10 minutes will return a 504 error.</Alert>

## Enable Whisper Model and Sizes

To enable Deepgram’s Whisper API, add a model parameter in the query string and set it to `model=whisper`

```bash
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper
```

To enable a specific size of the Whisper model, set the model parameter to `model=whisper-size`.

```bash
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper-SIZE
```

<Alert type="info">

If `model=whisper` is supplied and no model size specified, the model size will default to `model=whisper-medium`.

</Alert>

These are the Deepgram Whisper Cloud models available:

- `model=whisper` (defaults to whisper-medium)
- `model=whisper-tiny`
- `model=whisper-base`
- `model=whisper-small`
- `model=whisper-medium`
- `model=whisper-large` (defaults to large-v2)

## Other Features

### Language Detection

Deepgram Whisper Cloud supports language detection, which means just by setting `detect_language=true`, your audio will be transcribed in the detected language.
 
 Officially supported languages include Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh. ([Source: "Whisper API FAQ"](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7031512-whisper-api-faq))

If you would like to transcribe audio in a specific language, you can do so by setting the language parameter in the query string. You can pass in any language code supported by [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) through our `language` parameter. To learn more about languages, see [Language](/documentation/features/language/).
