# {frontmatter.title}

When working with the Deepgram API, it can be helpful to know how to see and save Deepgram transcripts directly in your terminal. In this guide, you'll learn how to use bash commands and scripts to execute directly in your terminal.

## Before You Start

Before you run the code, you'll need to do a few things.

### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes:

- $200 in credit, which gives you access to:
  - all base [models](/documentation/features/model/)
  - pre-recorded and [live streaming](/documentation/getting-started/streaming/) functionality
  - all [features](/documentation/features/)

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

### Install JQ

In this guide, we use `jq`, which is an excellent command-line utility that allows you to display and manipulate JSON data, so you will also need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Making a cURL Request

Open your terminal, and run the following cURL command:

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}' \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true'
```

<Alert type="warning">

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key.

</Alert>

Let’s look more closely at this request:

- `--request POST`: An HTTP request with the POST method.
- `--header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'`: Includes authorization details and links the request with your Deepgram account and Project.
- `--header 'Content-Type: application/json'`: JSON data that will be sent with this request.
- `--data '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}'`: JSON data sent to Deepgram (an object containing one URL parameter).
- `--url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true'`: URL to which the request should be made (Deepgram's endpoint). `punctuate=true` enables the [punctuation](/documentation/features/punctuate/) feature.
- `\`: Allows you to break one command over several lines for readability.

When you run this command and it is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that looks similar to the following:

This may look daunting, so let's look at a way to make both our cURL request and our response easier to read.

## Shortening Your cURL Request

Now that you've seen a full cURL request and understand the required parameters, let's look at a more concise way to make the same request:

```bash
curl https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true \
     -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}'
```

In this example, notice:

- The URL comes immediately after the `curl` command.
- No HTTP method is present. Normally, this would default to a GET request, but because this request has a body, cURL assumes a POST request.
- `--header` is shortened to `-H`
- `--data` is shortened to `-d`.

## Formatting Your JSON Response

To make the JSON response more readable, you can use `jq`, which is an excellent command-line utility that allows you to display and manipulate JSON data.

In the terminal, a pipe (`|`) is often used to send the output of one command as an input for a second command. `jq` expects some JSON as input, plus an expression to describe how to display it.

The following `jq` expression will extract just the transcript from the returned data object:

` | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript'`

To use it, add it to the end of your cURL request:

```bash
curl https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}' \
  | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript'
```

<Alert type="warning">

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key.

</Alert>

When you run this command and it is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that looks similar to the following:

![A terminal showing just the transcript text](./jq.png)

## Saving Output to a File

Once you have the transcript extracted and formatted using `jq`, you can redirect the output to a new file by appending `> output.txt` to any command that prints to the terminal. For example:

```bash
curl https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}' \
  | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript'
  > output.txt
```

## Processing Multiple Files

To process multiple files, you can create `.sh` files containing multiple lines of `bash` script to execute from your terminal.

Create a new file called `transcripts.sh`, and open it in a code editor. Populate it with the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

urls=("https://static.deepgram.com/examples/TrumpDemocratsMeeting.nancyshort.wav" "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav" "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/deep-learning-podcast-clip.wav")

dg_features="punctuate=true&utterances=true&diarize=true&tier=enhanced"
dg_key="YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"

for url in ${urls[@]}; do
  filename=${url##*/}

  RESPONSE=$(
    curl -X POST https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?$dg_features \
         -H "Authorization: Token $dg_key" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d "{\"url\":\"$url\"}"
  )

  echo $RESPONSE | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript' > $filename.txt
done
```

<Alert type="warning">

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key.

</Alert>

In this file, notice:

- The first line (`#!/bin/bash`) is a shebang and specifies which program should be called to run the script. In this case, `bash`.
- `urls` is a variable containing an array with three URLs. The arrays use parentheses, and items are separated by only one space.
- `dg_features` and `dg_key` are variables you should alter for your exact use case. Note that the request, as written, uses Deepgram's punctuation, utterances, diarize, and tier features included in the `dg_features` variable.
- Inside the `for` loop:
  - `filename` extracts the last part of the URL (the filename), which will later be used to name the output file.
  - The `curl` command is the same as before, but with variables interpolated. The output is stored in a new variable called `RESPONSE`.
  - `RESPONSE` is sent to `jq`, and then redirected into a new text file.

Run the file in your terminal:

```bash
./transcripts.sh
```

## Experimenting with jq

`jq` is a remarkable powerful tool that you can use to format data in more advanced ways. For example, the following expression will loop through the `results.utterances` array and format a string for each item, interpolating the speaker identifier and transcript text:

```bash
echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.results.utterances[] | "[Speaker:\(.speaker)] \(.transcript)"' > $filename.txt
```

When you run a previous cURL command with this `jq` appended and it is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response formatted in the following way:

```
[Speaker:0] agreement on other things that are really good. Nancy, would you like to say something?
[Speaker:1] Well, thank you, mister president for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way
[Speaker:1] to meet the needs of the American people. I think the American people recognize
[Speaker:1] that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything.
[Speaker:1] And that you should
```
