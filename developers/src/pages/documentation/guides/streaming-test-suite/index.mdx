If you're looking to get started with Deepgram's audio streaming capabilities, our streaming test suite is the perfect place to begin. The test suite provides sample code that allows you to easily stream basic audio to Deepgram, ensuring that you have the necessary foundation to build custom integrations.

Before diving into building your own integration, we highly recommend running through the steps in our test suite at least once to ensure that you can stream sample audio to Deepgram successfully. This will help you avoid many potential issues and streamline the integration process for sending your own audio to our system.

The test suite includes many ways to help diagnose problems. If you encounter issues, the test suite will provide more details on the error as well as steps to fix it.

With our streaming test suite, you can feel confident that you are laying a solid foundation for your audio streaming needs. Let's get started!

## Set Up

### Prerequisites

You must have:

- Python >= 3.6+
- [portaudio](http://portaudio.com/), if you plan to stream audio from your microphone
- A valid Deepgram API key (you can create one in our [Console](https://console.deepgram.com/))

### Installation

1. Check out the [streaming test suite](https://github.com/deepgram/streaming-test-suite/) repository
2. `pip install requirements.txt` 

## 1. Streaming a Local Source

The first step in getting started with Deepgram's audio streaming capabilities is to learn how to stream a local audio source to Deepgram. This simple task allows you to learn the basic concepts of how Deepgram's API works without worrying about complexities that arise with other audio sources. Additionally, it ensures that you can receive results from Deepgram in your development environment.

The streaming test suite provides sample code that facilitates this process. Before building your own integration, we recommend running this code at least once to make sure that you can stream audio to Deepgram successfully. 

### Stream a File

While streaming a file isn't our recommended way to use Deepgram's real-time transcription service (we suggest our [pre-recorded API](https://developers.deepgram.com/documentation/getting-started/prerecorded/) for that), it's a quick and easy way to make sure your API key and network are functioning correctly.

Just run the following command:

`python test_suite.py -k YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`

<Alert type="info">
Make sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with an API key generated from our [Console](https://console.deepgram.com/).
</Alert>

This will stream the included file, `preamble.wav`, to Deepgram and print out transcripts to your terminal.

You can also stream your own WAV file by running:

`python test_suite.py -k YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY -i /path/to/audio.wav`  

To check out how this functionality is implemented, look at the conditional `elif method == 'wav'` in our `sender` function.

### Stream Your Microphone

The streaming test suite also has the ability to send audio from your microphone to Deepgram for transcription. 

First, make sure pyaudio and its portaudio dependency are installed, and you have a microphone connected to your computer. Then, run:

`python test_suite.py -k YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY -i mic`

## Subtitle Generation

In addition to printing transcripts to the terminal, the test suite can also wrap Deepgram's responses in two common subtitle formats, SRT or VTT. 

To generate SRT or VTT files, add the `-o/--output` parameter when running the test suite:

`python test_suite.py -k YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY [-i mic|/path/to/audio.wav] [-o text|vtt|srt]`

This parameter defaults to `text`, which outputs responses to your terminal.

If you were able to successfully stream local audio and receive a transcript, you're ready to move on to the next step!

## 2. Streaming a Remote Source

The next step in getting started with Deepgram's audio streaming capabilities is to learn how to stream a remote audio source to Deepgram. This task introduces slightly more complexity and requires managing multiple asynchronous remote sources—one for audio input to Deepgram, one for Deepgram's transcription output.

### Stream a URL

Make sure you have the URL for direct audio stream to test with. A good way of testing this is to open the URL in a browser—you should see just the built-in browser audio player without an accompanying web page.

Here are a few URLs for you to try:

- BBC Radio 4 (outside the UK): http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_fourlw_online_nonuk
- BBC Radio 4 (inside the UK): http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_fourfm
- France Inter: https://direct.franceinter.fr/live/franceinter-midfi.mp3

If you use the French channel, be sure to add `language=fr` to your Deepgram URL.

Then, run the test suite to see the results:

`python test_suite.py -k YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY -i http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_fourlw_online_nonuk`

To check out how this functionality is implemented, look at the conditional `elif method == url` in our `sender` function. We use the `aiohttp` library to make an asynchronous request and open a session, then send content to Deepgram.

## 3. Streaming Your Audio

Now that you've validated you can stream WAV files and URLs to Deepgram, it's time to start the process of integrating your own audio. To do this, we'll start by taking a step back…and removing Deepgram from the picture!

Let's set the `test_suite.py` file aside for the moment. In addition to that file, the test suite also comes with a mock server and client: `server.py` and `client.py`. These are intended to create the simplest possible environment to test your custom audio.

The mock server exposes a similar interface to Deepgram's streaming service. It accepts websocket connections that specify an encoding, sample rate, and number of channels; and it expects a stream of raw audio. However, it doesn't transcribe that audio. All it does is send back messages confirming how much audio data has been received, and once the client closes the stream, it saves all sent audio to a file.

Using the mock server for testing allows you to focus on getting your audio and client code right. Once you're confident that your audio stream is configured correctly and you're streaming the audio you expect, you can easily swap to sending that audio to Deepgram's service.

### Run the Mock Server

Start by running the mock server:

`python server.py`

Then, open another terminal window and prepare to run the mock client. 

The mock client accepts these parameters:

`python client.py [-i INPUT] [-e ENCODING] [-s SAMPLE_RATE] [-c CHANNELS]` 

The test suite comes with a raw audio file, `preamble.raw` , that you can use to test streaming to the mock server. You can stream `preamble.raw` with the mock client like so:

`python client.py -i preamble.raw -e linear16 -s 8000 -c 1`

When you run the mock client, you should see output confirming that the mock server has begun to receive your audio.

### Validate Your Audio

At the end of an audio stream, the mock server saves all audio data that was sent in a timestamped RAW file. It will return the filename to you at the end of the stream.

You need to ensure the audio the server received is the audio you intended to send. To validate this, open this file in a program like Audacity (specifying necessary parameters like the encoding and sample rate) and try to play it back. You should be able to listen to your audio and verify it's correct.

### Stream to Deepgram

Once you verify your audio is correct, you can try streaming that audio to Deepgram. To do so, simply swap the websocket URL in `client.py` to point to Deepgram—the correct URL is left in a comment for you. 

Don't forget add your DG API key to the websocket headers where it says `YOUR_DG_API_KEY`.

If you were able to stream to the mock server, and have validated your audio sounds correct, you should be able to seamlessly start receiving transcriptions from Deepgram.

## Wrap-Up

By following the test suite steps, you've built your knowledge of working with websockets, audio, and Deepgram's system. We hope this guide has enabled you to build your own custom audio integrations with confidence.
