Deepgram’s Callback feature allows you to supply a callback URL to which transcriptions can be returned. When passed, Deepgram will immediately respond with a `request_id` before processing your audio asynchronously.

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for Callback include:

- Customers with large amounts of audio that may be slow to process.
- Customers who don't require immediate results.

## Enable Feature

To enable Callback, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `callback` parameter in the query string and set it to the URL to which you would like transcriptions sent:

`callback=URL`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace the placeholder `URL` with your chosen callback URL and `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

```

## URL Structure

An example URL is `https://example.com/callback`.

Your callback URLs may reference the following protocols:

- For pre-recorded audio: `http` or `https`
- For streaming audio, `http`, `https`, `ws`, or `wss:`

<Alert type="warning">

If a WebSocket callback connection is disconnected at any point, the entire real-time transcription stream is killed; this maintains the strong guarantee of a one-to-one relationship between incoming real-time connections and outgoing WebSocket callback connections.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

You may embed basic authentication credentials in the callback URL.

Only ports 80, 443, 8080, and 8443 may be used for callbacks.

</Alert>

## Results

Depending on the type of submitted audio, the response will vary.

### Pre-recorded Audio

When Deepgram has finished analyzing the audio, it will send a `POST` request to the provided callback URL with an appropriate HTTP status code.

### Streaming Audio

As Deepgram analyzes the audio, the way in which it sends requests back to the provided callback URL varies:

- If your callback URL begins with `http://` or `https://`, then Deepgram will send `POST` requests to the callback server for each streaming response.
- If your callback URL begins with `ws://` or `wss://`, then Deepgram will establish a WebSocket connection with the callback server and send WebSocket text messages that contain the streaming responses.
