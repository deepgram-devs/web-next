For self-serve customers, Deepgram provides the following architectures.

* **Nova** models are our newest and most powerful speech-to-text model on the market today. Nova's vast and diverse training data sets it apart.  Nova's performance is an incredible 50% better than the competition, making it the top choice for applications that demand high accuracy in diverse contexts. It's also our most cost effective models to use.

* **Enhanced** models are still some of our most powerful ASR models. Enhanced models generally have higher accuracy with better word recognition than our Base models and they handle uncommon words significantly better.

* **Base** models are built on our signature end-to-end deep learning speech model architecture and offer a solid combination of accuracy and cost effectiveness.

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for tiers include:

- Customers who want to provide clearer instructions to the API concerning which model level they’re expecting.
- Customers who have multiple methods of interacting with their own customers, such as both a conversational AI and an agent assist provider. A conversational AI that interacts directly with a person may require a higher tier than an agent assist provider that makes suggestions to a customer service representative who is talking to a person.
- Customers who operate a business-to-business (B2B) model that focuses on selling products and services to other companies. Each of the businesses serviced may require different tiers.

## Enable Feature

To enable tiers, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `tier` parameter in the query string and set it to the tier you would like to use:

`tier=OPTION`

<Alert type="warning">

Tiers are enabled for on-premises deployments, but are accessed differently than they are for hosted customers. For an on-premises deployment, when you call Deepgram’s API, use the `model` parameter in the query string and append `-enhanced` after the name of the model you would like to use:

`model=OPTION-enhanced`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace the placeholder `OPTION` with your chosen tier and `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

### Tier Options

For self-serve customers, Deepgram provides Nova, Whisper, Enhanced and Base models. To learn more about pricing, see [Deepgram Pricing & Plans](https://deepgram.com/pricing/). To learn about which models are available for which tiers, see [Models](/documentation/features/model/).


- `Nova`: our newest and most powerful speech-to-text model on the market today; they are the top choice for applications that demand high accuracy in diverse contexts. They are also our most cost effective models to use.
- `Enhanced`: still some of our most powerful ASR models; they generally have higher accuracy and better word recognition than our Base models, and they handle uncommon words significantly better.
- `Base`: built on our signature end-to-end deep learning speech model architecture. They offer a solid combination of accuracy and cost effectiveness in some cases.

<Alert type="warning">

When a tier is submitted with a request, you should also submit only a model associated with that tier; submitting a model that is not associated with the submitted tier will result in a parse error.
