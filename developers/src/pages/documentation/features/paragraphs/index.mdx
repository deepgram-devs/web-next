Deepgram's Paragraphs feature splits audio into paragraphs to improve transcript readability. When Paragraphs is enabled, at least one of the following features must also be enabled: Punctuation, Diarization, Multichannel. When the Diarization feature is enabled and multiple speakers are present, paragraphs breaks are influenced by speaker changes. When the Multichannel feature is enabled, paragraphs breaks are influenced by channel changes.

## Use Cases

Examples of use cases for Paragraphs include:

- Customers who require easy transcript formatting.
- Customers who would like to be able to format speaker summaries more effortlessly.

## Enable Feature

To enable Paragraphs, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `paragraphs` parameter in the querystring and set it to `true`:

<Alert type="warning">

When Paragraphs is enabled, at least one of the following features must also be enabled: Punctuation, Diarization, Multichannel. In this example, we have chosen Punctuation.

</Alert>

`paragraphs=true&punctuate=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

<Alert type="info">

When Paragraphs is enabled, either the Punctuation, Diarization, or Multichannel feature must also be enabled.

## Analyze Response

For this example, we use a WAV audio file that contains an interview about speech analytics. If you would like to follow along, you can [download it](https://developers.deepgram.com/data/audio/interview_speech-analytics.wav).

In our terminal, we run the following cURL command:

<CodeGroup title="curl">

<CodeBlock label="curl" active>

```curl
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"url":"https://developers.deepgram.com/data/audio/interview_speech-analytics.wav"}' \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?paragraphs=true&punctuate=true'
```

</Alert>

When the file is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

```json
{
	"metadata": {
		"transaction_key": "string",
		"request_id": "string",
		"sha256": "string",
		"created": "string",
		"duration": 0,

		"model_info": {}
	},
	"results": {
		"channels": [
			{
				"alternatives": []
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Let's look more closely at the `alternatives` object:

In this response, we see that each alternative contains:

- `transcript`: Transcript for the audio being processed.
- `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
- `words`: Object containing each word in the transcript, along with its start time and end time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a confidence value.
- `paragraphs`: Object containing the information about paragraph divisions for the audio being processed.

And we see that each `paragraphs` object contains:

- `transcript`: Transcript for the audio being processed, including line breaks where the transcript is divided into paragraphs.
- `paragraphs`: Object containing sentences in the paragraph. Each nested `paragraphs` object contains:
  - `sentences`: Object containing each sentence in the paragraph, along with a count of the number of words in the paragraph, and the start and end times for each paragraph.
  - `num_words`: Count of the number of words in the paragraph.
  - `start`: Number of seconds into the audio stream that the paragraph starts.
  - `end`: Number of seconds into the audio stream that the paragraph ends.

Finally, we see that each `sentence` object contains:

- `text`: Text contained in the sentence.
- `start`: Number of seconds into the audio stream that the sentence starts.
- `end`: Number of seconds into the audio stream that the sentence ends.
