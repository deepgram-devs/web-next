Deepgram’s Sample Rate feature allows you to specify the sample rate of your submitted audio.

The Sample Rate feature is required when the [Encoding](/documentation/features/encoding/) feature is being used to submit streaming raw audio. It is not read at any other time.

## Enable Feature

To enable Sample Rate, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `sample_rate` parameter in the query string and set it to the sample rate of your submitted audio.

`sample_rate=SAMPLE_RATE_VALUE`

<Alert type="warning">

When submitting audio encoded with the [Adaptive Multi-rate (AMR)](/documentation/glossary/#A) codec, you must submit specific Sample Rate values:

- `amr-nb`: AMR narrowband codec. When using this option, you must specify `sample_rate=8000` (`encoding=amr-nb&sample_rate=8000`).
- `amr-wb`: AMR wideband codec. When using this option, you must also specify `sample_rate=16000` (`encoding=amr-wb&sample_rate=16000`).

</Alert>

For an example of audio streaming, see [Getting Started with Streaming Audio](/documentation/getting-started/streaming/).
