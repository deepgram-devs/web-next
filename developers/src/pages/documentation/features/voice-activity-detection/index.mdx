Deepgram’s Voice Activity Detection (VAD) feature monitors incoming audio and detects when a sufficiently long pause is detected. By default, the length of time Deepgram uses for voice activity detection (VAD) is 10 ms, but you can configure this value using the `vad_turnoff` parameter.

VAD is used when the [Endpointing](/documentation/features/endpointing/) feature is enabled for streaming audio.

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for VAD include:

- Audio with speakers who pause longer while speaking than the average speaker.
- Audio with speakers who speak with shorter pauses than the average speaker.

## Enable Feature

To enable VAD, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `vad_turnoff` parameter in the query string and set it to the length of time (in milliseconds) of silence after which Deepgram will decide that a speaker has finished speaking. The default values is 10 ms.

`vad_turnoff=LENGTH-OF-TIME-IN-MILLISECONDS`

For an example of audio streaming, see [Getting Started with Streaming Audio](/documentation/getting-started/streaming/).
