<div class="badge">PRE-RECORDED</div>

Deepgram’s Utterances feature segments speech into meaningful semantic units, which allows the chosen model to interact more naturally and effectively with speakers' spontaneous speech patterns. For example, when humans speak to each other conversationally, they often pause mid-sentence to reformulate their thoughts, or stop and restart a badly-worded sentence. When `utterances` is set to `true`, these utterances are identified, so you can present a transcript with a more natural speaking pattern.

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for utterances include:

- Customers who would like to perform analysis on output by utterance. For example, their call center would like to track how the sentiment progresses throughout their customer calls, so they can determine whether their interactions with callers trend from negative to positive or vice versa.

## Enable Feature

To enable utterances, when you call Deepgram’s API, add an `utterances` parameter set to `true` in the query string:

`utterances=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

## Analyze Response

<Alert type="info">

For this example, we use a WAV audio file that contains the beginning of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. If you would like to follow along, you can [download it](https://developers.deepgram.com/data/audio/gettysburg.wav).

</Alert>

When the file is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

```json
{
	"metadata": {
		"transaction_key": "string",
		"request_id": "string",
		"sha256": "string",

	},
	"results": {

Let’s look more closely at the `utterances` object:

In this response, we see that each utterance contains:

- `start`: Start time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream.
- `end`: End time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream.
- `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
- `channel`: Audio channel to which the utterance belongs. When using multichannel audio, utterances are chronologically ordered by channel.
- `transcript`: Transcript for the audio segment being processed.
- `words`: Object containing each word in the transcript, along with its start time and end time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a confidence value.

By default, Deepgram applies its general AI model, which is a good, general purpose model for everyday situations. To learn more about the customization possible with Deepgram's API, check out the [Deepgram API Reference](/api-reference/).

## Advanced Processing

You may also want to enable speaker diarization, which will detect and identify speakers for utterances, and punctuation.

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response that has the same basic structure as before. Let’s take a closer look at the new `utterances` object:

In this response, notice that the content of `transcript` in each utterance is now punctuated, and each `word` object in the `words` array contains two new parameters:

- `speaker`: Integer indicating the speaker who is saying the word being processed.
- `punctuated_word`: Word being processed with added punctuation, if any.

To improve readability, you can use a JSON processor to parse the JSON. In this example, we use [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
