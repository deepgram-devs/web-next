Deepgram’s Tagging feature allows you to label your API requests for the purpose of identification during usage reporting. You can also apply tags to API Keys; if you do, any tags applied to the API Key running the API request will also be applied to the request itself.

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for Tagging include:

- Customers who have multiple, related business projects and need to track separate usage.
- Customers who have projects managed by different business teams or under different cost centers.
- Customers who operate a business-to-business (B2B) model that focuses on selling products and services to other companies. Rather than creating separate projects to track usage data, you can create a separate API Key for each company and tag it with the their information. Any requests run using the API Key will also be tagged with that company's information.

## Enable Feature

To enable Tagging, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `tag` parameter in the query string and set it to the tag you would like to recognize:

`tag=VALUE`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace the placeholder `VALUE` with your tag and `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tag=VALUE'
```

<Alert type="warning">

Make sure you are certain about what you want your tag to be. Once you have set a tag, you cannot update it.

</Alert>

### Apply a Single Tag

To apply just one tag, send one instance of the `tag` parameter in the query string when calling the API:

`tag=marketing`

If your tag includes spaces or special characters, be sure to URL encode your tag:

`tag=marketing%20team` or `tag=marketing+team`

### Apply Multiple Tags

To apply multiple tags, submit the `tag` parameter multiple times in your API request:

`tag=marketing&tag=legal`

## Filter Requests by Tag

Once applied, you can identify tags associated with API requests returned by the [Get All Requests](/api-reference/usage/#get-all-requests), [Get Request](/api-reference/usage/#get-request), and [Get Fields](/api-reference/usage/#get-fields) endpoints.

You can also directly query requests by tag at the [Summarize Usage](/api-reference/usage/#summarize-usage) endpoint.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace the placeholder `PROJECT_ID` with your Deepgram Console Project ID, `VALUE` with your tag, and `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).
