Deepgram’s Utterance Split feature monitors incoming audio and detects when a sufficiently long pause is detected between words. By default, the length of time Deepgram uses for Utterance Split is 0.8 seconds, but you can configure this value using the `utt_split` parameter.

Utterance Split is used when the [Utterances](/documentation/features/utterances/) feature is enabled for pre-recorded audio.

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for Utterance Split include:

- Audio with speakers who pause longer while speaking than the average speaker.
- Audio with speakers who speak with shorter pauses than the average speaker.

## Enable Feature

To enable Utterance Split, when you call Deepgram’s API, add an `utt_split` parameter in the query string and set it to the length of time (in seconds) of silence between words after which Deepgram will decide that a new utterance should begin. The default values is 0.8 s.

`utt_split=LENGTH-OF-TIME-IN-SECONDS`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client:
