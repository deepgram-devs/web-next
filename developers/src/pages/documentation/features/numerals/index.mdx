Deepgram’s Numerals feature converts numbers from written format to numerical format. For example, the number "nine hundred" would appear in your transcript as "900".

<Alert type="info">

When punctuation is enabled, converted numbers do not include it. For example, 999,999 will always be transcribed as 999999.

<Alert type="warning">

This feature is available for English only ([all available regions](/documentation/features/language/#enable-feature)).

</Alert>

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for numerals include:

- Customers who handle long strings of numbers, such as product numbers or account numbers.
- Customers who want general customer information, such as addresses and phone numbers, and dates to show up in a more readable format in transcripts.

## Enable Feature

To enable numerals, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `numerals` parameter set to `true` in the query string:

`numerals=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace the placeholder `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

<CodeGroup title="curl">

<CodeBlock label="curl" active>

```bash
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?numerals=true'
```

### Toggling Numerals during a real-time stream

In addition to the query string parameter, if you're sending real-time streaming data, you can turn Numerals on or off at any point during the stream. To do so, send the following JSON message to the websocket:

```json
{
  "type": "Configure",
  "features": {
    "numerals": true (or false)
  }
}
```

Numerals can be turned on and off multiple times during a stream if desired.

## Results

Once applied, results will appear in the transcript.
