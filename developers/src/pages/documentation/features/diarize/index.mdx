Deepgram’s Diarize feature recognizes speaker changes and assigns a speaker to each word in the transcript.

To learn more about diarization and multichannel audio, and to learn when to use Deepgram's Diarization or Multichannel feature, see [Understanding when to Use the Multichannel and Diarization Features](/documentation/guides/multichannel-vs-diarization/).

## Use Cases

An example of a use case for Diarization includes:

Customers who use audio with multiple speakers and want transcripts to appear in a more readable format.

## Enable Feature

To enable Diarization, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `diarize` parameter set to `true` in the query string:

`diarize=true`

<Alert type="warning">
  
If you want to use our legacy Diarization feature, when you call Deepgram’s API, add an additional `diarize_version` parameter set to `2021-07-14.0` in the query string:

`diarize=true&diarize_version=2021-07-14.0`

</Alert>

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

## Analyze Response

<Alert type="info">

For this example, we use an MP3 audio file that contains the beginning of a customer call with Premier Phone Services. If you would like to follow along, you can [download it](https://developers.deepgram.com/data/audio/premier_broken-phone.mp3).

</Alert>

When the file is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "transaction_key": "string",
    "request_id": "string",
    "sha256": "string",
    "created": "string",
    "duration": 0,
    "channels": 0
  },
  "results": {
    "channels": [
      {
        "alternatives":[]
      }
    ]
  }
```

Let's look more closely at the `alternatives` object:

```json

In this response, we see that each alternative contains:

- `transcript`: Transcript for the audio being processed.
- `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
- `words`: Object containing each word in the transcript, along with its start time and end time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, a word confidence value, a speaker identifier, and a speaker confidence value.

By default, Deepgram applies its general AI [model](/api-reference/transcription/#model-pr), which is a good, general purpose model for everyday situations. To learn more about the customization possible with Deepgram's API, check out the [Deepgram API Reference](/api-reference/).

To improve readability, you can use a JSON processor to parse the JSON. In this example, we use [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and further improve readability by turning on Deepgram’s [punctuation](/documentation/features/punctuate/) and [utterances](/documentation/features/utterances/) features:
