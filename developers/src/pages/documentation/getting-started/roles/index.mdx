Deepgram uses a tiered system of access control to provide granular access to its endpoints. These tiers include account (or global) permissions and project permissions. Applying different tiers of permissions allows for more granularity at the project level. For example, an account may have the `project:kick` permission for one project but not for another project.

## Account Roles

At the account level, certain permissions imply other specific permissions. For example, an account that has access to the `project:write` permission also implicitly has access to the `project:read` permission. Similarly, `account:write` access implies access to every other account permission.

## Project Roles

At the project level, users can have access to several roles, including `owner`, `admin`, and `member`, which, similar to account permissions, imply access to another set of permissions:
