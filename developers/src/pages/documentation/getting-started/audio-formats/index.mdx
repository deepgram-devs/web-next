Deepgram supports over 100 different audio formats and encodings. Some of the most common audio formats and encodings we support include:

- MP3
- MP4
- MP2
- AAC
- WAV
- FLAC
- PCM
- M4A
- Ogg
- Opus
- WebM
- And more...

Because audio format is largely unconstrained, we always recommend to ensure compatibility by testing small sets of audio when first operating with new audio sources.

If you're interested in learning about how Deepgram works with a specific format or would like more information about working with your audio, please [contact Support](/support/).
