Nova is Deepgram's most powerful and affordable speech-to-text model. Training on this model spans over 100 domains and 47 billion tokens, making it the deepest-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to date. Nova doesn't just excel in one specific domain — it is ideal for a wide array of voice applications that require high accuracy in diverse contexts. 

Here's how you can get started with Nova.

## Before You Begin

Before you run the code, you'll need to do a few things.

### Create a Deepgram Account

You'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and no credit card is needed.

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

## Transcribe Pre-recorded Audio

Transcribe a pre-recorded audio file using Nova with the following request.

<Alert type="info">

The Node.js and Python examples below use the Deepgram SDKs. Check out our [SDKs & Tools](/sdks-tools) to learn more.

		console.log(err);
	});

## API Examples

The url to use Nova is the following:

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova
```

Nova can also be used with the phonecall model as a tier:

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=phonecall&tier=nova

```

If you use the following url, it will give the same results as using `model=nova`:

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=general&tier=nova

```

<Alert type="warning">

Do not use `tier=enhanced` or `tier=base` with the Nova model. Using a url such as `https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova&tier=enhanced` or `https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova&tier=base` throws an error.

</Alert>
