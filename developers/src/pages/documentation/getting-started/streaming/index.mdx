In this guide, you'll learn how to automatically transcribe live streaming audio in real time using Deepgram's SDKs, which are supported for use with the [Deepgram API](/api-reference/).

## Before You Begin

Before you run the code, you'll need to do a few things.

### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes:

- $150 in credit, which gives you access to:
  - all base [models](/documentation/features/model/)
  - [pre-recorded](/documentation/getting-started/prerecorded/) and live streaming functionality
  - all [features](/documentation/features/)

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

### Configure Environment

We provide sample scripts in Python and Node.js and assume you have already configured either a Python or Node development environment. System requirements will vary depending on the programming language you use:

- **Node.js**: node >= 14.14.37, cross-fetch >= 3.1.5
- **Python**: python >= 3.7, aiohttp >= 3.8.1

<Alert type="info">

If you get stuck at any point, help is just a click away! [Contact Support](/support/).

</Alert>

## Transcribe Audio

Once you have your API Key, it's time to transcribe audio!

If you want a quick way to get up and running, our [Python streaming test suite](https://github.com/deepgram/streaming-test-suite) provides sample code to help you get started. Before beginning to build your own integration, we recommend running the test suite code at least once to ensure you can successfully stream sample audio to Deepgram.

If you'd like to follow a step-by-step tutorial, our instructions below will guide you through the process of creating a sample application, installing the Deepgram SDK, configuring code with your own Deepgram API Key and streaming audio to transcribe, and finally, building and running the application.

### Install the SDK

Open your terminal, navigate to the location on your drive where you want to create your project, and install the Deepgram SDK:

<CodeGroup title="Example" default="Node.js" tabs={["Node.js", "Python"]}>

<CodeBlock tab="Python">

```bash
# Install the Deepgram Python SDK
# https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk
pip install deepgram-sdk
```

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock tab="Node.js" active>

```bash
# Initialize a new application
npm init

# Install the Deepgram Node.js SDK
# https://github.com/deepgram/node-sdk
npm install @deepgram/sdk
```

</CodeBlock>

</CodeGroup>

### Add Dependencies

Add necessary external dependencies to your project.

<CodeGroup title="Example" default="Node.js" tabs={["Node.js", "Python"]}>

<CodeBlock tab="Python">

```bash
# Install aiohttp: HTTP client/server for asyncio that allows you to write asynchronous clients and servers, and supports WebSockets.
pip install aiohttp
```

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock tab="Node.js" active>

```bash
# Install cross-fetch: Platform-agnostic Fetch API with typescript support, a simple interface, and optional polyfill.
npm install cross-fetch
```

</CodeBlock>

</CodeGroup>

### Write the Code

In your terminal, create a new file in your project's location, and populate it with code.

<Alert type="info">

The following example includes the parameter `model=nova`, which tells the API to use Deepgram's most powerful and affordable model. Removing this parameter will result in the API using the default model, which is currently `model=general`.

</Alert>

<CodeGroup title="Example" default="Node.js" tabs={["Node.js", "Python"]}>

<CodeBlock tab="Python">

```python
 # Example filename: deepgram_test.py

from deepgram import Deepgram
import asyncio
import aiohttp

# Your Deepgram API Key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'

# URL for the realtime streaming audio you would like to transcribe
# The URL for the sample resource changes depending on whether the user is outside or inside the UK
# Outside the UK
URL = 'http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_fourlw_online_nonuk'
# Inside the UK
# URL = 'http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_fourfm'

async def main():
  # Initialize the Deepgram SDK
  deepgram = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)

  # Create a websocket connection to Deepgram
  # In this example, punctuation is turned on, interim results are turned off, and language is set to UK English.
  try:
    deepgramLive = await deepgram.transcription.live({
      'punctuate': True,
      'interim_results': False,

    })
  except Exception as e:
    print(f'Could not open socket: {e}')
    return

  # Listen for the connection to close
  deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.CLOSE, lambda c: print(f'Connection closed with code {c}.'))

  # Listen for any transcripts received from Deepgram and write them to the console
  deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.TRANSCRIPT_RECEIVED, print)

  # Listen for the connection to open and send streaming audio from the URL to Deepgram
  async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.get(URL) as audio:
      while True:
        data = await audio.content.readany()
        deepgramLive.send(data)

        # If no data is being sent from the live stream, then break out of the loop.
        if not data:
            break

  # Indicate that we've finished sending data by sending the customary zero-byte message to the Deepgram streaming endpoint, and wait until we get back the final summary metadata object
  await deepgramLive.finish()

# If running in a Jupyter notebook, Jupyter is already running an event loop, so run main with this line instead:
#await main()
asyncio.run(main())

<Alert type="warning">

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key.

</Alert>

### Start the Application

Run the application from the terminal.

<CodeGroup title="Example" default="Node.js" tabs={["Node.js", "Python"]}>

<CodeBlock tab="Python">

```bash
# Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
# Example: python deepgram_test.py
python YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.py
```

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock tab="Node.js" active>

```bash
# Run your application using the file you created in the previous step
# Example: node index.js
node YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.js
```

</CodeBlock>

</CodeGroup>

<Alert type="warning">

Be sure to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` with the name of the file to which you saved the code in the previous step.

</Alert>

### See Results

Your transcripts will appear in your browser's developer console.

<Alert type="warning">

Deepgram does not store transcriptions. Make sure to save output or [return transcriptions to a callback URL for custom processing](/documentation/features/callback/).

</Alert>

By default, Deepgram live streaming looks for any deviation in the natural flow of speech and returns a finalized response at these places. To learn more about this feature, see [Endpointing](/documentation/features/endpointing/).

Deepgram live streaming can also return a series of interim transcripts followed by a final transcript. To learn more, see [Interim Results](/documentation/features/interim-results/).

<Alert type="info">

Endpointing can be used with Deepgram's [Interim Results](/documentation/features/interim-results/) feature. To compare and contrast these features, and to explore best practices for using them together, see [Using Endpointing and Interim Results with Live Streaming Audio](/documentation/guides/understand-endpointing-interim-results/).

</Alert>

## What's Next?

Now that you've gotten transcripts for streaming audio, enhance your knowledge by exploring the following areas.

### Customize Transcripts

To customize the transcripts you receive, you can send a variety of parameters to the Deepgram API.

For example, if your audio is in Spanish rather than UK English, you can pass the `language:` parameter with the `es` option to the `transcription.live` method in the previous examples.

<Alert type="warning">

Not all languages work with all available models. Be sure to check out the [Languages](/documentation/features/language/) page to see which models are compatible with which languages.

</Alert>

<CodeGroup title="Example" default="Node.js" tabs={["Node.js", "Python"]}>

<CodeBlock tab="Python">

```python
deepgramLive = await deepgram.transcription.live({
  'punctuate': True,
  'interim_results': False,
  'language': 'es'
})
```

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock tab="Node.js" active>

```js
const deepgramLive = deepgram.transcription.live({
	punctuate: true,
	interim_results: false,
	language: "es",
});
```

</CodeBlock>

</CodeGroup>
