Deepgram's API gives you streamlined access to Deepgram products, including automatic transcription from Deepgram's off-the-shelf and trained speech recognition models, and to all of your Deepgram resources, such as your account's projects, API keys, billing settings and balances, and usage statistics.
<br/>
[Our SDKs](/sdks-tools/) make integrating and interacting with our API quick and easy.
