## Endpoint

https://api.deepgram.com/v1

## Authentication

Send requests to the API with an `Authorization` header that references your project's API Key:

`Authorization: Token <YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY>`

You can [create a Deepgram API Key in the Deepgram Console](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/). You must create your first API Key using the Console.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests made without authentication will also fail.
