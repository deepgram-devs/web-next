# {frontmatter.title}
Scopes are permissions required to perform actions in a specified Deepgram Project. Scopes can be associated with Keys or Users. When associated with a Key, Scopes determine the actions that the Key can be used to perform in the Key's associated Project. When associated with a Member, Scopes determine what the user can do in their assigned Project. For more information, see [Working with Roles](/documentation/getting-started/roles/).

### Get Member Scopes

Lists the specified project scopes assigned to the specified member. If the authenticated account has access to the `members:read:scopes`, `admins:read:scopes`, and `owners:read:scopes` project scopes, it will retrieve project scopes for any member of the specified project. Otherwise, it will retrieve project scopes for only the authenticated account.

Required account scope(s): `account:read`, `project:read`. Required project scope(s): `project:read`. Optional project scope(s): `members:read:scopes`, `admins:read:scopes`, `owners:read:scopes`.

### Update Scope

Updates the specified project scopes assigned to the specified member.

If the specified member has the scope `member` or the scope being added is `member`, the requesting account must have the scope `members:write:scopes`. If the specified member has the scope `admin` or the scope being added is `admin`, the requesting account must have the scope `admins:write:scopes`. If the specified member has the scope `owner` or the scope being added is `owner`, the requesting account must have the scope `owners:write:scopes`.

If the scope being added is `member`, `admin`, or `owner`, it will replace the existing `member`, `admin`, or `owner` scope of the specified member unless the specified member is the only member with the `owner` scope. In this case, the request will fail.

If the scope being added is not `member`, `admin`, or `owner`, then the requesting account must also have the scope that it is trying to add to the specified member. For example, if the requesting account tries to add the `project:write:settings` project scope to a specified member, but the requesting account itself does not have the scope `project:write:settings`, then the request will fail.

Required account scope(s): `project:write`. Optional project scope(s): See the description.
