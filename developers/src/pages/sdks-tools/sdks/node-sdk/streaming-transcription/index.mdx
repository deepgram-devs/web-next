# {frontmatter.title}

The `transcription.live` function encapsulates a websocket connection to the
Deepgram API and returns a Node.js
[event emitter](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/the-nodejs-event-emitter/). Events
received from the Deepgram API are emitted for consumption by your application.

## Parameters

Additional options can be provided for streaming transcriptions. They are
provided as an object of the `transcription.live` function. Each of these
parameters map to a feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the
[features documentation](/documentation/features/) to learn what features may
be appropriate for your request.

## Initiating a Connection

The `transcription.live` function will return a Node.js
[event emitter](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/the-nodejs-event-emitter/) that your
application can subscribe to events on.

```js
const deepgramLive = deepgram.transcription.live({
	punctuate: true,
	// additional options
});
```

## Events

The following events are fired by the live transcription object:

| Event                | Description                                           | Data                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`               | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been opened. | The DG live transcription object                                                  |
| `close`              | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been closed. | WebSocket.CloseEvent                                                              |
| `error`              | An error occurred with the websocket connection       | Error object                                                                      |
| `transcriptReceived` | Deepgram has responded with a transcription           | [Transcription response](/api-reference/#transcription-streaming-response-schema) |

### Listening to Events

Use the `addListener` function to listen for events fired on the
object returned from the `transcription.live` function.

```js
deepgramLive.addListener("transcriptReceived", (transcription) => {
	console.log(transcription.data);
});
```

## Functions

The object returned by the `transcription.live` function provides several
functions to make using the Deepgram API easier. They are `send`,
`getReadyState`, `toggleNumerals`, and `finish`.

### Sending Data

The `send` function sends raw audio data to the Deepgram API.

```js
deepgramLive.send(AUDIO_STREAM_DATA);
```

### Get Ready State

The `getReadyState` function returns the [ready state of the websocket connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/readyState)
to Deepgram.

```js
const websocketReadyState = deepgramLive.getReadyState();
```

### Toggle Features

The `configure` function gives the ability to toggle different features. Currently, only the `numerals` feature is supported with plans to add more in the future. The function takes in an object with features to toggle to determine whether or not to enable the feature.

```js
deepgramLive.configure({numerals: true}); // enable numerals
deepgramLive.configure({numerals: false}); // disable numerals
```

This function is a shorthand way of sending the following data to the websocket connection:

```js
deepgramLive.send(
	JSON.stringify({
		type: "Configure",
		processors: {
			numerals: true, // or false
		},
	})
);
```

### Closing the Connection

The `finish` function closes the Websocket connection to Deepgram.

```js
deepgramLive.finish();
```

### Browser

Using the browser compatible SDK is slightly different. You still make the call to `.live()` and pass in the options you want applied to the transcription, but some of the events are different. We are abstracting the [native WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).

```js
import { Deepgram } from "@deepgram/sdk/browser";
const deepgram = new Deepgram("YOUR_API_KEY");
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true }).then((stream) => {
	const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, {
		mimeType: "audio/webm",
	});
	const deepgramSocket = deepgram.transcription.live({
		punctuate: true,
	});
	deepgramSocket.addEventListener("open", () => {
		mediaRecorder.addEventListener("dataavailable", async (event) => {
			if (event.data.size > 0 && deepgramSocket.readyState == 1) {
				deepgramSocket.send(event.data);
			}
		});
		mediaRecorder.start(1000);
	});
	deepgramSocket.addEventListener("message", (message) => {
		const received = JSON.parse(message.data);
		const transcript = received.channel.alternatives[0].transcript;
		if (transcript && received.is_final) {
			console.log(transcript);
		}
	});
});
```
