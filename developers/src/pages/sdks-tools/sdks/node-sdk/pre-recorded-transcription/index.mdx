The Deepgram client has a `transcription` property that allows you to request
transcripts for pre-recorded audio. To request a transcript for a pre-recorded
particular audio file, you'll use the `transcription.preRecorded` function.

## Pre-recorded Transcription Parameters

| Parameter | Type                       | Description                                |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| source    | Buffer, Object, ReadStream | Provides the source of audio to transcribe |
| options   | Object                     | Parameters to filter requests. See below.  |

You can pass a Buffer, ReadStream, or URL
to a file to transcribe. Here's how to construct each:

### Sending a URL

```js
// Sending the URL to a file
const audioSource = { url: URL_OF_FILE };
```

### Sending a Buffer

<Panel type="warning" title="Node Only">

The SDK only supports sending Buffers from Node. The in-browser version of the
SDK only provides the capability to send URL sources.

</Panel>

Import the `fs` Node library to access your file system. Then use its
`readFile` function providing the path to your file. That function will return
a buffer that can then be passed in to the Deepgram client. You will also need
to provide the MIMETYPE of the file.

```js
const fs = require("fs");

// Sending a Buffer of the file
fs.readFile("/path/to/file", function (err, buffer) {
	const audioSource = { buffer: buffer, mimetype: MIMETYPE_OF_FILE };
});
```

### Sending a ReadStream

<Panel type="warning" title="Node Only">

The SDK only supports sending Buffers from Node. The in-browser version of the
SDK only provides the capability to send URL sources.

</Panel>

Import the `fs` Node library to access your file system. Then use its
`createReadStream` function providing the path to your file. The ReadStream
it creates can then be passed in to the Deepgram client. You will also need
to provide the MIMETYPE of the file.

```js
const fs = require("fs");

// Sending a ReadStream
const audioSource = {
	stream: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/file"),
	mimetype: MIMETYPE_OF_FILE,
};
```

### Pre-recorded Transcription Options

Additional transcription options can be provided for pre-recorded
transcriptions. They are provided as an object as the second parameter of the
`transcription.preRecorded` function. Each of these parameters map to a
feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the
[features documentation](/documentation/features/) to learn what features may
be appropriate for your request.

## Pre-recorded Transcription Example Request

With the source you chose above, call the `transcription.preRecorded` function
and provide any [additional options](#pre-recorded-transcription-options) as
an object.

```js
const response = await deepgram.transcription.preRecorded(audioSource, {
	punctuate: true,
	// other options are available
});
```

## Helper Functions

The SDK provides a few helper functions for converting pre-recorded
transcriptions into common caption formats, like WebVTT and SRT.

<Panel type="info" title="Utterances are Required for Helper Functions">

In order to use the helper functions, the `utterances` feature must be used when
transcribing the audio.

</Panel>

### Converting to WebVTT

Each pre-recorded transcription object provides a `toWebVTT` function to convert
the transcript to the WebVTT format.

```js
const response = await deepgram.transcription.preRecorded(audioSource, {
	punctuate: true,
	utterances: true,
});
const webvttTranscript = response.toWebVTT();
```

### Converting to SRT

Each pre-recorded transcription object provides a `toSRT` function to convert
the transcript to the SRT format.

```js
const response = await deepgram.transcription.preRecorded(audioSource, {
	punctuate: true,
	utterances: true,
});
const srtTranscript = response.toSRT();
```
