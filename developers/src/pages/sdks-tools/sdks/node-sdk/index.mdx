This guide documents all the functionality available in the Deepgram
Node.js SDK, and explains in detail how the library works. All the official
Deepgram SDKs are open source. To learn more about this SDK specifically, visit
the [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/node-sdk) repository on GitHub.

<Panel type="info" title="Important Note">

Currently, the Deepgram Node SDK supports Node.js 14.14.37 and higher.

## Pre-requisites

Before using the Node.js SDK, you'll need to do a few things.

### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to
[create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is
free and includes:

$200 in credit, which gives you access to:
  - all base models
  - pre-recorded and streaming functionality
  - all features

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgramâ€™s API, you'll need to
[create a Deepgram API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key).
Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

## Installation

You can install the Deepgram Node.js SDK as a dependency in your application
using NPM or yarn. Here's how:

### With NPM

```bash
npm install @deepgram/sdk
```

### With Yarn

```bash
yarn add @deepgram/sdk
```

## Initialization

Once the SDK is installed, import the Deepgram object. The method for importing
will vary based on your use case.

### Node

In Node applications, import the Deepgram object from `@deepgram/sdk`.

```js
const { Deepgram } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
```

### Browser

When using the Deepgram SDK in a front-end application, import the Deepgram
object from `@deepgram/sdk/browser`.

```js
import { Deepgram } from "@deepgram/sdk/browser";
```

### Instantiating the Client

With the Deepgram object imported, create a new instance specifying your API
key so that your application will be authorized to connect to Deepgram.

```js
const deepgram = new Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);
```

With the Deepgram client initialized, you can now send requests to the Deepgram
API to transcribe audio, manage projects & keys, and retrieve usage information.
