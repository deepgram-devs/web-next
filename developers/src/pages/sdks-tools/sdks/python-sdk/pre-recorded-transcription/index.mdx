# {frontmatter.title}

The Deepgram client has a `transcription` property that allows you to request
transcripts for pre-recorded audio. To request a transcript for a pre-recorded
particular audio file, you'll use the `transcription.prerecorded` function.

## Pre-recorded Transcription Parameters

| Parameter | Type        | Description                                |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| source    | Buffer, Url | Provides the source of audio to transcribe |
| options   | Object      | Parameters to filter requests. See below.  |

You can pass a Buffer or URL to a file to transcribe. Here's how to construct
each:

### Sending a URL

```py
source = {'url': URL_TO_AUDIO_FILE}
```

### Sending a Buffer

Open a file and send the buffer returned. You will also need to provide the
MIMETYPE of the file.

```py
with open(PATH_TO_FILE, 'rb') as audio:
  source = {'buffer': audio, 'mimetype': MIMETYPE_OF_FILE}
```

### Pre-recorded Transcription Options

Additional transcription options can be provided for pre-recorded
transcriptions. They are provided as an object as the second parameter of the
`transcription.prerecorded` function. Each of these parameters map to a
feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the
[features documentation](/documentation/features/) to learn what features may
be appropriate for your request.

## Pre-recorded Transcription Example Request

With the source you chose above, call the `transcription.prerecorded` function
and provide any [additional options](#pre-recorded-transcription-options) as
an object.

```py
response = await dg_client.transcription.prerecorded(source, {'punctuate': True})
```
