This guide documents all the functionality available in the Deepgram
Python SDK, and explains in detail how the library works. All the official
Deepgram SDKs are open source. To learn more about this SDK specifically, visit
the [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk) repository on GitHub.

## Pre-requisites

Before using the Python SDK, you'll need to do a few things.

### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to
[create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is
free and includes:

$150 in credit, which gives you access to:

- all base models
- pre-recorded and streaming functionality
- all features

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgramâ€™s API, you'll need to
[create a Deepgram API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key).
Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

## Installation

You can install the Deepgram Python SDK as a dependency in your
application using `pip`. Using a virtual environment is recommended
when installing packages in Python instead of a global installation.
You can learn more about how to do that
in [this article](/blog/2022/02/python-virtual-environments/).

Here's how to install Deepgram with `pip`:

```bash
pip install deepgram-sdk
```

Next you should import the Deepgram client in your application code:

```py
from deepgram import Deepgram
```

## Initialization

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single instance
of the Deepgram client. You should specify your API key here so that your
application will be authorized to connect to Deepgram.

```py
dg_client = Deepgram(DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)
```

With the Deepgram client initialized, you can now send requests to the Deepgram
API to transcribe audio, manage projects & keys, and retrieve usage information.
