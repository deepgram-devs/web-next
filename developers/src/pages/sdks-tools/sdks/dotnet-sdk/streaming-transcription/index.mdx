The `CreateLiveTranscriptionClient` method encapsulates a websocket connection
to the Deepgram API and returns a class that emits events received from the'
Deepgram API for consumption by your application.

<Panel type="info" title="LiveTranscriptionClient lifecycle">

The `LiveTranscriptionClient` is Disposable so it should always be created in a
'using' to ensure it is disposed of properly.

</Panel>

## Initiating a Connection

The `StartConnectionAsync` method initiates a connection with the Deepgram API via websocket. You
may pass in options for the transcription as well.

```csharp
using (var deepgramLive = deepgram.CreateLiveTranscriptionClient())
{
  var options = new LiveTranscriptionOptions()
  {
    Punctuate = true,
    Diarize = true,
    Encoding = Deepgram.Common.AudioEncoding.Linear16
  };
  await deepgramLive.StartConnectionAsync(options);
}

```

## Events

The following events are fired by the `LiveTranscriptionClient`:

| Event                | Description                                           | Data                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ConnectionOpened`   | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been opened. | The DG live transcription object                                                  |
| `ConnectionClosed`   | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been closed. | WebSocket.CloseEvent                                                              |
| `ConnectionError`    | An error occurred with the websocket connection       | Error object                                                                      |
| `TranscriptReceived` | Deepgram has responded with a transcription           | [Transcription response](/api-reference/#transcription-streaming-response-schema) |

### ConnectionOpened

Fires when the WebSocket connection to Deepgram has been opened. Ensure you
begin sending your audio data once the connection to Deepgram has been
established.

<Panel type="info" title="Note">

The example below demonstrates sending a pre-recorded audio to simulate a
real-time stream of audio. In a real application, this type of audio is better
handled using the pre-recorded transcription.

</Panel>

```csharp
using (var deepgramLive = deepgram.CreateLiveTranscriptionClient())
{
    deepgramLive.ConnectionOpened += HandleConnectionOpened;

    // Connection opened so start sending audio.
    void HandleConnectionOpened(object? sender, ConnectionOpenEventArgs e)
    {
        byte[] buffer;

        using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead("C:\\Users\\Michael\\Desktop\\Bueller.wav"))
        {
            buffer = new byte[fs.Length];
            fs.Read(buffer, 0, (int)fs.Length);
        }

        var chunks = buffer.Chunk(1000);

        foreach (var chunk in chunks)
        {
            deepgramLive.SendData(chunk);
            Task.Delay(50).Wait();
        }

        deepgramLive.FinishAsync();
    }
}
```

### ConnectionClosed

Fires when the WebSocket connection is closed.

```csharp
using (var deepgramLive = deepgram.CreateLiveTranscriptionClient())
{
    deepgramLive.ConnectionClosed += HandleConnectionClosed;

    void HandleConnectionClosed(object? sender, ConnectionClosedEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.Write("Connection Closed");
    }
}
```

### ConnectionError

Fires on any error in the connection, sending or receiving.

```csharp
using (var deepgramLive = deepgram.CreateLiveTranscriptionClient())
{
    deepgramLive.ConnectionError += HandleConnectionError;

    void HandleConnectionError(object? sender, ConnectionErrorEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Exception.Message);
    }
}
```

### TranscriptReceived

Fires when a transcript is received from the Deepgram API.

```csharp
using (var deepgramLive = deepgram.CreateLiveTranscriptionClient())
{
    deepgramLive.TranscriptReceived += HandleTranscriptReceived;

    void HandleTranscriptReceived(object? sender, TranscriptReceivedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Transcript.IsFinal &&
            e.Transcript.Channel.Alternatives.First().Transcript.Length > 0) {
            var transcript = e.Transcript;
            Console.WriteLine($"{transcript.Channel.Alternatives.First().Transcript}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Functions

The object returned by the `transcription.live` function provides several
functions to make using the Deepgram API easier. They are `send`,
`getReadyState`, and `finish`.

### Sending Data

The `SendData` method sends raw audio data to the Deepgram API.

```csharp
deepgramLive.SendData(AUDIO_STREAM_DATA);
```

### Get Websocket State

The `State` method returns the ready state of the websocket connection
to Deepgram.

```csharp
var websocketReadyState = deepgramLive.State();
```

### Finish Transcribing

The `FinishAsync` method sends a signal to the Deepgram API that you have finished
streaming audio and it should conclude its transcription efforts. Upon sending
the final transcript back it will close the websocket connection.

```csharp
deepgramLive.FinishAsync()
```

### Closing the Connection

The `StopConnectionAsync` method closes the Websocket connection to Deepgram.

<Panel type="warning" title="You may want FinishAsync instead.">

In most instances, the `FinishAsync` method should be used to end a streaming
session. Otherwise, the final transcript will not be received. Using the `FinishAsync`
method will also cause the connection to close.

```csharp
deepgramLive.StopConnectionAsync()
```
