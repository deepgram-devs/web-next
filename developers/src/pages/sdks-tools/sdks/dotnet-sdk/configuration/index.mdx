The Deepgram .NET SDK provides three ways to configure the Deepgram client:

- Via the `DeepgramClient` constructor
- Via an `appsettings.json` or `settings.json` file
- Via a Configuration instance

Below are examples of how to do each.

## DeepgramClient Constructor

The `DeepgramClient` constructor allows you to provide a Deepgram API key and
optional custom API url.

```csharp
var credentials = new Credentials(YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);
var deepgramClient = new DeepgramClient(credentials);
```

## Settings Files

If a `Credentials` object is not provided in the `DeepgramClient` constructor, the
client will look for parameters within an `appsettings.json` or `settings.json`
file.

```js
{
  "appSettings": {
    "Deepgram.Api.Key": "YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY",
    "Deepgram.Api.Uri": "https://api.deepgram.com"
  }
}
```

In the event multiple configuration files are found, the order of precedence is
as follows:

- appsettings.json
- settings.json

</Panel>

## Configuration Instance

If you have an existing `Configuration` instance, you can provide your settings
to it directly.

```csharp
Configuration.Instance.Settings["appSettings:Deepgram.Api.Key"] = "YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY";
Configuration.Instance.Settings["appSettings:Deepgram.Api.Uri"] = "https://api.deepgram.com";
```
