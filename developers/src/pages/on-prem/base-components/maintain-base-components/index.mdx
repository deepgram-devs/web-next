# {frontmatter.title}

Periodically, you will need to update configure and data files or install product updates for your on-premises (on-prem) deployment.

## Updating Configuration and Data Files

If you modify configuration files or update data files or artifacts (for example, apply a new model update), then you will need to restart Docker services to get changes to take effect.

1. Log in to Docker:

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. Restart Docker services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f /path/to/compose.yml -p deepgram up -d --force-recreate
   ```

## Installing Product Updates

Deepgram periodically makes new product updates to the Docker images available. Some updates are recommended, while others are mandatory and, if not installed, will result in Deepgram products ceasing to function. To install product updates:

1. [Contact Support](/support/) to get the latest version numbers for the Deepgram API and Deepgram Engine images, and update your `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.

2. Log in to Docker:

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

3. Download and apply product updates:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml pull
   docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml -p deepgram up -d
   ```

## Managing Licenses

If you have ever been issued an on-prem license file for specialized, offline/air-gapped deployments, please contact your Deepgram Account Representative for additional documentation about maintaining your license.

## Backing up Deepgram Products

When backing up a Deepgram installation, you should back up the following artifacts:

- `docker-compose.yml`
- `api.toml`
- `engine.toml`
- directory housing the models that you use in your requests

We highly recommend backing up your whole server, if possible. Doing so will ensure that you can easily restore a running system.
