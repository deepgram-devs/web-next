# {frontmatter.title}

Deepgram offers a plugin for speech recognition for the UniMRCP Server (UMS), which is a popular open-source project that offers cross-platform MRCP services. To use this plugin with on-prem deployments, you must take some additional steps.

## Deploying UniMRCP On-prem

In addition to the installation guide posted at [UMS Deepgram SR - Deb Installation Manual](https://docs.unispeech.io/en/ums/deepgram/speech-recog/install-deb), the following changes are required to successfully integrate `umsdeepgram` with an on-prem deployment.

### Adding a new `service-endpoint` for on-prem

In the `umsdeepgram.xml` configuration file, add a `service-endpoint` child element to the `service-endpoints` element. You must specify the on-prem deployment’s IP address and port number in the `service-uri` attribute. On-prem’s URI is `/v2/listen/stream` and is only a web socket (`ws`), not a secure web socket (`wss`).

```xml
<service-endpoints load-balancing="round-robin" fail-over="true">
      <service-endpoint enable="true" service-uri="ws://ONPREM_IP_ADDRESS:ONPREM_PORT/v2/listen/stream"/>
</service-endpoints>
```

This can coexist alongside a hosted service-endpoint.

```xml
<service-endpoints load-balancing="round-robin" fail-over="true">
      <service-endpoint enable="true" service-uri="ws://ONPREM_IP_ADDRESS:ONPREM_PORT/v2/listen/stream"/>
      <service-endpoint enable="true" service-uri="wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"/>
</service-endpoints>
```

### Deepgram License Key

Even though the license key for Deepgram on-prem is specified in the `api.toml` and `engine.toml` files, and the Deepgram API only accepts HTTP ASR requests, the `deepgram.subscription.key` file must exist and match the schema specified in the plugin installation instructions for Deepgram hosted. This is especially important if Deepgram on-prem must coexist alongside a Deepgram-hosted `service-endpoint`.

```json
{
	"auth-key": "HOSTED_AUTH_KEY"
}
```

If you do not have a Deepgram-hosted authorization key, the `auth-key` value can be empty, such as:

```json
{
	"auth-key": ""
}
```
