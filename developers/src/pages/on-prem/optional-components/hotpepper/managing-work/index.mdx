When users log into Hotpepper, they are presented with the Hotpepper user dashboard.

Deepgram best practices require that all audio files be reviewed by four independent users. Hotpepper implements the idea of independent reviewers through the concept of levels, each of which represents a queue of unlabeled files that require different levels of effort. To learn more about Deepgramâ€™s suggested ordering of operations, visit [Hotpepper User Guide: Understanding the Workflow](/on-prem/optional-components/hotpepper/understanding-workflow/).

To select a file:

Select the level that corresponds to the desired review level. The system will automatically assign you a file from the selected queue and take you to the labeling view for the assigned file.

<Alert type="info">

While reviewing, you can pause your work before completion. If you have previously paused a file at the selected level, the system will automatically load the paused file into the labeling view, so you can finish your work.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">

Once you have finished labeling a file and marked it as done, the file is added to the queue for the next labeling level, and you will no longer be able to see it.

</Alert>
