# {frontmatter.title}

Deepgram's interconnected on-premises (on-prem) optional components support advanced features that enhance the Deepgram Engine and API.

<Alert type="info">

If you aren't certain which products your contract includes, please consult a Deepgram sales representative.

</Alert>

Optional components include:

- **Metrics Server**: Provides aggregate metrics about system performance. We recommend running a single instance of the metrics server in your on-prem deployment.

- **[License Proxy Server](/on-prem/optional-components/license-proxy-server/)**: Serves as an intermediary between our hosted license server and your on-prem deployment. We recommend installing this component to ensure constant uptime for request authorizations.

- **Hotpepper**: Allows you to build custom training datasets quickly and cost effectively while maintaining data quality. Also improves labeling efficiency by allowing users to submit audio to a hosted or on-prem Deepgram Engine for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and transcription.

- **[DGTools](/on-prem/optional-components/dgtools/)**: Simplifies the process of training a new model.

- **SIPREC**: For customers who would prefer to use Deepgram's real-time transcription on a traditional telephony stack rather than with WebSockets, Deepgram offers a native SIPREC integration solution.

- **[UniMRCP Plugin](/on-prem/optional-components/unimrcp/)**: Offers speech recognition for cross-platform MRCP services.
