Running on-premises (on-prem) Deepgram requires a valid license. If a valid license is missing, the Deepgram API and Engine containers will fail to start.

## Console API keys

On-prem API keys may be created by Console project owners. Steps to create on-prem API keys in Console:

1. Navigate to https://console.deepgram.com to login and select a Console project which you own.

2. Click "API Keys" in the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the screen to navigate to the API Keys page.

3. Click "Create a New API Key" on the API Keys page to open a key creation pop-up.

4. Provide a name for your Key and set your key permission level. If you are unsure which permission to use, select Owner. Use the default expiration value "never" and click "Create Key" to create the key and be shown your new secret API key.

5. Your new secret API key is shown to you. It is a 40 character alphanumeric string. Please copy this secret and save it somewhere safe. For security reasons, we can't show the secret to you again. You can always create a new key if you lose your old secret.

6. Check the box affirming that you know you can't access this key's secret again and click "Got it."

7. The pop-up will be dismissed and you will be back on the "API Keys" page where you can see your new on-prem API key and the On-prem products which are licensed to that key.

8. You can use the secret from your onprem API key in your `api.toml`, `engine.toml`, and `docker-compose.yml` files in place of your legacy on-prem license key.

```
# in api.toml & engine.toml
[license]
  # Your license key.
  key = "f1037f690e1c05405b0a71b8fc1df3d453b1bcad"

# in docker-compose.yml
license-proxy:
    image: deepgram/onprem-license-proxy:1.4.0

    ports:
      - "8443:8443"
      - "8089:8089"

    command: -v serve --license-key "f1037f690e1c05405b0a71b8fc1df3d453b1bcad" --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8443 --status-port 8089
```

## Online Licensing (legacy)

With online licensing, you receive a license ID that allows Deepgram products to communicate securely with the Deepgram Console in order to verify license terms and report usage.

Licensing connections are established every minute and are short-lived (a second or two). All communication with the Console is to `license.deepgram.com:443` using HTTPS to ensure a secure connection. Please ensure that your firewall is configured appropriately.

<Panel title="Data Security">

To ensure that your audio data never leaves your network, Deepgram maintains entirely separate endpoints for transcription and licensing. In addition, the Console licensing endpoint only accepts licensing data, which guards against accidental transmission. Finally, Deepgram products maintain a separate, isolated connection pool that they use to connect to Console.

To verify this, monitor packet sizes and throughput of data between your network and Deepgram. You'll notice that the licensing traffic is very small (a few kilobytes per minute)&mdash;far too small to accommodate audio data leaving your network.

For customers deploying Deepgram’s on-prem solution in production, we also recommend installing Deepgram’s [License Proxy Server](/on-prem/optional-components/license-proxy-server/), which is a caching proxy for communications with the Deepgram-hosted license server. The License Proxy Server is an optional component that ensures uptime and simplifies network security. To learn more, please consult your Deepgram Account Representative.
