# {frontmatter.title}

A quick guide for enabling metrics in On-Prem instances.

## Docker Compose

Within the docker compose `YAML` file you must expose the port `9991` in Engine for metrics services.

```yml
services:
  engine:
    # other definitions
    ports:
      - "9991:9991"
```

## Engine TOML

Within the `engine.toml` file you must expose the `9991` port.

```toml
# To support metrics we need to expose an Engine endpoint
[metrics_server]
  host = "0.0.0.0"
  port = 9991
```

Metrics may now be queried from the on-prem instance at `http://<ip-address>:9991/metrics`.

## Metrics

Upon startup of the services a limited set of metrics will be available until the first request is made. After the first request is made a complete set of metrics will be available.
