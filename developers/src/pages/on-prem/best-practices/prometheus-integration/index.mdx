Integrating a Deepgram On-Prem instance with Prometheus for metrics logging. Prometheus is a powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit, often used for collecting and querying various system metrics.

## Introduction

This guide outlines the steps required to integrate Prometheus with an on-prem instance that has a metrics endpoint `/metrics` on port `9991`.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following:

- Access to the on-prem instance with the metrics endpoint exposed. (See [here](/on-prem/best-practices/metrics-guide/))
- Prometheus installed on your machine or server. (Visit [Download Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/) for installation instructions.)
- Permission to modify the Prometheus configuration file (usually named `prometheus.yml`)

## Steps to Integrate with the On-Prem Instance

### Step 1: Add Prometheus Target

Add the target to the Prometheus configuration file in the `prometheus.yml` file; locate the `scrape_configs` section, and add a new job with the on-prem instance as a target:

```yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "on_prem_instance"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<INSTANCE_IP>:9991"]
```

Replace `<INSTANCE_IP>` with the IP address or hostname of the on-prem instance. Save the configuration file.

### Step 2: Reload Prometheus Configuration

To apply the changes made to the `prometheus.yml` file, you need to reload the Prometheus configuration. You can do this by restarting the Prometheus service:

```
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

### Step 3: Verify the Integration

Open the Prometheus web interface, usually accessible at `http://localhost:9090`, and navigate to the "Targets" page (under the "Status" menu). You should see the `on_prem_instance` job listed with a status of "UP", indicating that Prometheus is successfully scraping metrics from the on-prem instance.

#### Querying Metrics

With the integration complete, you can now query the collected metrics using the Prometheus web interface or API. To access the metrics endpoint directly, visit `http://<INSTANCE_IP>:9991/metrics` in your browser or use a tool like `curl` to fetch the data.

## Conclusion

You've now successfully integrated your on-prem instance with a Prometheus. You can now monitor and query the on-prem system metrics collected from the instance using the Prometheus web interface or API.
