The `DeepgramClient` has a `Transcription.Prerecorded` property that allows you
to request transcripts for pre-recorded audio. To request a transcript for a
pre-recorded particular audio file, you'll use the
`Transcription.Prerecorded.GetTranscriptionAsync` method.

## Transcription Sources

There are two types of sources that can be provided for transcription:

### UrlSource

Provides a url to the file to transcribe.

```csharp
var response = await deepgram.Transcription.Prerecorded.GetTranscriptionAsync(
    new UrlSource("URL_TO_FILE"));
```

### StreamSource

Provide a stream containing the file to transcribe.

```csharp
using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead("PATH_TO_FILE"))
{
    var response = await deepgram.Transcription.Prerecorded.GetTranscriptionAsync(
        new StreamSource(stream, "MIMETYPE_OF_FILE "));
}
```

## Helper Functions

The SDK provides a few helper functions for converting pre-recorded
transcriptions into common caption formats, like WebVTT and SRT.

<panel type="info" title="Utterances are Required for Helper Functions">

In order to use the helper functions, the `Utterances` feature must be used when
transcribing the audio.

</panel>

### Converting to WebVTT

Each pre-recorded transcription object provides a `ToWebVTT` function to convert
the transcript to the WebVTT format.

```csharp
var response = await deepgram.Transcription.Prerecorded.GetTranscriptionAsync(
    new UrlSource("URL_TO_FILE"),
    new PrerecordedTranscriptionOptions()
    {
        Punctuate = true,
        Utterances = true
    });
var srtTranscript = response.toWebVTT();
```

### Converting to SRT

Each pre-recorded transcription object provides a `ToSRT` function to convert
the transcript to the SRT format.

```csharp
var response = await deepgram.Transcription.Prerecorded.GetTranscriptionAsync(
    new UrlSource("URL_TO_FILE"),
    new PrerecordedTranscriptionOptions()
    {
        Punctuate = true,
        Utterances = true
    });
var srtTranscript = response.ToSRT();
```
