The `DeepgramClient` class provides access to manage API keys via the `Keys`
property. Each request is project based and will require a Deepgram project id.

## List Project API Keys

You can retrieve all keys for a given project using the `ListKeysAsync` method.

```csharp
var keys = await deepgram.Keys.ListKeysAsync("DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID");
```

## Get Specific API Key

You can retrieve a specific API key for a given project using the `GetKeyAsync`
method. You will need the API keys unique id.

```csharp
var response = await deepgram.Keys.GetKeyAsync("DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID", "KEY_ID");
```

## Create API Key

Create a new API key for a project using the `CreateKeyAsync` method
with a name for the key.

```csharp
var response = await deepgram.Keys.CreateKeyAsync("DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID", "NAME_FOR_KEY", new string[] {"member"});
```

## Delete API Key

Delete an existing API key using the `DeleteKeyAsync` method with project id and
key id to delete.

```csharp
var response = await deepgram.Keys.DeleteKeyAsync("DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID", "KEY_ID");
```
