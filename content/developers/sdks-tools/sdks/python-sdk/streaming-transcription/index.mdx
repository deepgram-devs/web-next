The `transcription.live` function creates a websocket connection to the
Deepgram API. It tries to create this connection and throws an exception 
if it could not open the socket, by using the `try/except` code block.

## Parameters

Additional options can be provided for streaming transcriptions. They are
provided as an object of the `transcription.live` function. Each of these
parameters map to a feature in the Deepgram API. Reference the
[features documentation](/documentation/features/) to learn what features may
be appropriate for your request.

## Initiating a Connection

The `transcription.live` function creates a websocket connection to the
Deepgram API. It tries to create this connection and throws an exception 
if it could not open the socket, by using the `try/except` code block.

```python
try:
  deepgramLive = await deepgram.transcription.live({ 'punctuate': True })
except Exception as e:
  print(f'Could not open socket: {e}')
  return
```

Please note that additional options can be passed into `transcription.live`, 
such as `interim_results`, `language`, etc. See the **Paremeters** section above
for a list of all the options. These options are passed as
dictionary objects with key/value pairs.

```python
deepgramLive = await deepgram.transcription.live({ 'punctuate': True, 'interim_results': False, 'language': 'en-GB' })
```

## Events

The following events are fired by the live transcription object:

| Event                | Description                                           | Data                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`               | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been opened. | The DG live transcription object                                                  |
| `close`              | The websocket connection to Deepgram has been closed. | WebSocket.CloseEvent                                                              |
| `error`              | An error occurred with the websocket connection       | Error object                                                                      |
| `transcript_received` | Deepgram has responded with a transcription           | [Transcription response](/api-reference/transcription/#response-schema-1) |

### Listening to Events

Use the `registerHandler` function to listen for events fired on the
object returned from the `transcription.live` function.

Listen for the event to `close` and print out the message `Connection closed with code {c}.`,
where `{c}` is a string argument. 

```python
deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.CLOSE, lambda c: print(f'Connection closed with code {c}.'))
```

Listen for any transcripts to be received and print them to the console. 

```python
deepgramLive.registerHandler(deepgramLive.event.TRANSCRIPT_RECEIVED, print)
```

## Functions

The object returned by the `transcription.live` function provides several
functions to make using the Deepgram API easier. They are `send` and `finish`.


### Listen for Open Connection

Create a **ClientSession** called `session` and a **ClientResponse** object
called `audio`, which gets the information needed from the response.

The `send` function sends raw audio data to the Deepgram API, while reading
in the contents of the audio.

```python
deepgramLive.send(await audio.content.readany())
```

```python
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    async with session.get(URL) as audio:
      while True:
        deepgramLive.send(await audio.content.readany())
```

### Closing the Connection

The `finish` function closes the Websocket connection to Deepgram.

```python
await deepgramLive.finish()
```
