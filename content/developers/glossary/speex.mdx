title: Speex
description: "Lossy audio coding algorithm specifically tuned for the
  reproduction of human speech and targeted at voice over IP (VoIP) and
  file-based compression. Design goals included optimizing for high quality
  speech and low bit rate, so Speex uses multiple bit rates and supports
  ultra-wideband (32 kHz sampling rate), wideband (16 kHz sampling rate), and
  narrowband (telephone quality, 8 kHz sampling rate). Speex is now considered
  obsolete; its successor is the more modern Opus codec, which surpasses its
  performance in most areas except at the lowest sample rates. However, Speex
  does claim to be free from patent restrictions. "
