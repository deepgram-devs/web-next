title: Word Error Rate (WER)
description: Common metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of automatic
  speech recognition systems (ASRs) and compare the accuracy of the transcripts
  they produce. The more technical, industry-specific, “accented”, and noisy
  your speech data is, the more likely that both ASRs (and humans) will yield a
  high WER.
