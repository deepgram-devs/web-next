title: Lossy
description: Class of compression algorithms that irreversibly degrade data
  quality to reduce size for storage, handling, and transmission. Well-designed
  lossy compression technology can significantly reduce file sizes before
  degradation is noticed by the end-user. Lossy compression is most commonly
  used to compress multimedia data (audio, video, and images), especially in
  applications such as streaming media and internet telephony.
