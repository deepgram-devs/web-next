title: Lossless
description: Class of compression algorithms that allow original data to be
  perfectly reconstructed from compressed data. Lossless compression is used in
  cases where deviations from the original data would be unfavorable. In audio,
  these cases most often involve archiving or production purposes where storage
  space is unlimited. It is also often used as a component within lossy data
  compression technologies (for example, in lossless mid/side joint stereo
  preprocessing by MP3 encoders and other lossy audio encoders).
