Administrators of on-premises (on-prem) deployments of Deepgram products sometimes encounter the following issues.

## Problems installing the NVIDIA drivers

Sometimes loaded kernel modules can interfere with the installation of the NVIDIA drivers. To correct this issue, try unloading `nouveau` drivers:

```bash
sudo rmmod nouveau
```

## Failed to find any CUDA devices

1. Ensure that NVIDIA drivers are installed:

    ```bash
    nvidia-smi
    ```

    If not, install them before proceeding.

2. Ensure that `nvidia-docker` is installed:

    ```bash
    docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda:9.0-base nvidia-smi
    ```

    If not, install it before proceeding.

3. If you have made changes to NVIDIA drivers, restart Docker:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```

## Deepgram will not start

Running Deepgram on premises requires a valid license. If you think you have an expired license or invalid license ID, [contact Support](/support/) for help.
