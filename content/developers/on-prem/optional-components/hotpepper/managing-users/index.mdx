To view more about a user’s individual progress, select their email address.

</div>

To add a user to Hotpepper:

1. Navigate to **Admin > Users**, and locate the **Add a User** section.

2. Enter the user’s **Email Address** and desired **Password**, then select the user’s **Permission** level:

    | Level | Permission |
    | ----- |----- |
    | user  | May label data. |
    | admin | May label data, manage users, view user labeling progress, and manage datasets. |

    <Alert type="info">

    While we suggest using email addresses as usernames, the **Email Address** field is not validated, and Hotpepper does not send account emails to users. You may enter a username in any format you prefer.

    </Alert>

3. If the user is certified to work with data subject to HIPAA regulations, select **HIPAA authorized**. The user will be allowed access to datasets marked as **Contains HIPAA data**. To learn how to mark a dataset as containing HIPAA data, visit [Hotpepper User Guide: Adding Datasets](/on-prem/optional-components/hotpepper/managing-datasets/#adding-datasets).

4. Select **Add User**.

## Reviewing Individual User Progress

Hotpepper allows administrators to track individual user progress. To access these tools, navigate to **Dashboard > Admin > Users**, and select an individual user’s email address.

By default, lifetime user progress is displayed; however, the time period displayed can be narrowed to today, weekly, or monthly.

Administrators can track total progress or progress by level, including:

- Time spent
- Audio time completed
- Calculated time spent per unit of output

They can also view progress by file, including file duration, level, and the date/time of completion.
