Analyzing the talk time of participants in a classroom, meeting, or phone
call can help you improve participant engagement, sales presentations,
and support response. Using Deepgram's Transcription API with diarization,
you can gather the data you need to make informed decisions about your
organization's interactions.

## Before You Begin

The example provided is written in Node.js, and you can [find the code
on GitHub](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/talk-time-analytics).

Before you run the code, you'll need to do a few things:

### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes:

$150 in credit, which gives you access to:
  - all base models
  - pre-recorded and streaming functionality
  - all features

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

## Getting Started

You can run this application by remixing it on Glitch or by running it on your local computer.

### Remix on Glitch

[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) comes with an online editor, so you'll have all the necessary tools to explore your own application instance. Actions taken in Glitch are subject to [Glitch’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](https://glitch.com/legal) and are not covered by any Deepgram agreements.

To remix this application on Glitch, go to the following URL:

> https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/dg-uc-talk-time-analytics?PORT=3000

When accessing this URL in your browser, the project will be forked and deployed.

#### Configure the Settings

Your application will need to know more about you before it can run successfully. Edit the environment variables (`.env`) to reflect the settings you want to use:

- `PORT`: The port on which you want to run the application. We generally set this to port 3000.
- `DG_KEY`: The API Key you created earlier in this tutorial.

Once these variables are set, the application should run automatically.

### Run on localhost

You can also run this project on your local computer. To do so, you will need to clone the repository,
configure the settings, install the dependencies, and start the server.

#### Clone the Repository

Either clone or download the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/talk-time-analytics) to your
local machine in a new directory:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/deepgram-devs/talk-time-analytics.git

# Move to the created directory
cd talk-time-analytics
```

#### Configure the Settings

Your application will need to know more about you before it can run. Copy the
`.env-example` file into a new file named `.env`, and edit the new file to
reflect the settings you want to use:

- `PORT`: The port on which you want to run the application. You can leave this as port 3000.
- `DG_KEY`: The API Key you created earlier in this tutorial.

#### Install the Dependencies

In the directory where you downloaded the code, run the following command to
bring in the dependencies needed for this project:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start the Server

Now that you have configured your application and put the dependencies in place, your application
is ready to go! Run it with:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the application runs on port 3000, which means you can access it at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Code Walk-through

The application is an Express app that uses Chart.js to create a pie
chart that displays calculated talk time. The key logic that calculates
talk time lives in the `server.js` file.

### Sending Data to the Deepgram API

When a user uploads a file, we call the `requestDeepgramAPI` function. This
function calls the Deepgram API via an `https` request. The key parameter on this
request is `diarize=true`. This parameter tells the Deepgram API to recognize
speaker changes. When activated, the Deepgram API will assign a zero-based
speaker index to each word in the transcript.

```javascript
function requestDeepgramAPI({ res, filename, fileUrl, contentType, payload }) {
  try {
    const deepgram = new Deepgram(DG_KEY)
    let audioObj

    if (typeof payload === 'string') {
      audioObj = { url: fileUrl }
    } else {
      audioObj = { buffer: payload, mimetype: contentType }
    }

    const transcription = await deepgram.transcription.preRecorded(audioObj, {
      punctuate: true,
      diarize: true,
    })

    const speakers = computeSpeakingTime(transcription)
    res.render('analytics.ejs', {
      speakers,
      filename,
      fileUrl,
    })
  } catch (err) {
    error(res, err)
  }
}
```

### Calculating Talk Time

Once the response is returned from the Deepgram API, we pass the transcript
data to the `computeSpeakingTime` function. In that function, we create a
new `Map<number, number>` named `timePerSpeaker`.

The Deepgram API specifies the start, end, and duration of each word it
identifies. That information, paired with the indexed speaker returned
by the diarization feature of the API, allows us to iterate through each
word calculating the full length of time that speaker spoke.

```javascript
function computeSpeakingTime(transcript) {
  const words = transcript.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].words

  if (words.length === 0) {
    return []
  }

  // `timePerSpeaker` tracks speaker time. Keys
  // are speaker ID; values are speaking time.
  const timePerSpeaker = new Map()
  let wordAtLastSpeakerChange = words.shift()
  for (const word of words) {
    // If the speaker changes at this word
    if (wordAtLastSpeakerChange.speaker !== word.speaker) {
      addSpeakingTime(
        wordAtLastSpeakerChange.speaker,
        word.end - wordAtLastSpeakerChange.start,
        timePerSpeaker
      )
      wordAtLastSpeakerChange = word
    }
  }

  const lastWord = words[words.length - 1]
  addSpeakingTime(
    wordAtLastSpeakerChange.speaker,
    lastWord.end - wordAtLastSpeakerChange.start,
    timePerSpeaker
  )

  return (
    // Convert the Map into an array
    [...timePerSpeaker.entries()]
      // Sort by speaker ID (keys of the Map)
      .sort((entryA, entryB) => entryA[0] - entryB[0])
      // Only keep the speaking times (the values of the Map)
      .map((entry) => entry[1])
  )
}

function addSpeakingTime(speaker, duration, timePerSpeaker) {
  const currentSpeakerDuration = timePerSpeaker.get(speaker) || 0
  timePerSpeaker.set(speaker, currentSpeakerDuration + duration)
}
```
