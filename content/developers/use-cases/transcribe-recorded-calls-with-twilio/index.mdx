The wealth of knowledge in the conversations that happen during your sales and
support calls can be left untapped without automatic transcription. Using
Deepgram's Transcription API, you can gather the data you need to make informed
decisions about your organization's interactions.

## In This Tutorial

You will see how to use the Deepgram API to calculate talk-time analytics for a
pre-recorded audio conversation:

- [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin): Set up your Deepgram account and API Key.
- [Getting Started](#getting-started): Clone the repository and get the application running, or remix it on Glitch.
- [Code Walk-through](#code-walk-through): Get a deeper understanding of how the application works.
- [Further Reading](#further-reading): Learn about other resources you might find helpful.

The example provided is written in Node.js, and you can [find the code
on GitHub](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/video-chat).

## Before You Begin

Before you run the code, you'll need to do a few things:

### Create a Deepgram Account

Before you can use Deepgram products, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup). Signup is free and includes:

- $150 in credit, which gives you access to:

  - all base models
  - pre-recorded and streaming functionality
  - all features

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

### Gather Twilio Credentials

This application uses Twilio Voice to start a phone call that will be recorded
and transcribed. Before you can use Twilio products, you'll need to
[sign up for a Twilio account](https://twilio.com).

To use the sample application, you'll need a Twilio Account SID
and Twilio Auth Token. These can both be found within your Twilio account
dashboard.

## Getting Started

You can run this application by remixing it on Glitch or by running it on
your local computer.

### Remix on Glitch

[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) comes with an online editor, so you'll have all the necessary tools to
explore your own application instance. Actions taken in Glitch are subject to [Glitch’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](https://glitch.com/legal) and are not covered by any Deepgram agreements.

To remix this application on Glitch, go to the following URL:

> <https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/dg-uc-recorded-call-transcription>

When accessing this URL in your browser, the project will be forked and deployed.

#### Configure the Settings

Your application will need to know more about you before it can run successfully. Edit the environment variables (`.env`) to reflect the settings you want to use:

- `YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: The Account SID from your Twilio Account Dashboard.
- `YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: The Auth Token from your Twilio Account Dashboard.
- `DG_KEY`: The API Key you created earlier in this tutorial.

Once these variables are set, the application should run automatically.

### Run on localhost

You can also run this project on your local computer. To do so, you will need
to clone the repository, configure the settings, install the dependencies, and
start the server.

#### Clone the Repository

Either clone or download the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/recorded-call-transcription)
to your local machine in a new directory:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/deepgram-devs/recorded-call-transcription.git

# Move to the created directory
cd recorded-call-transcription
```

#### Configure the Settings

Your application will need to know more about you before it can run. Copy the
`.env-example` file into a new file named `.env`, and edit the new file to
reflect the settings you want to use:

- `DG_KEY`: The API Key you created earlier in this tutorial.
- `YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: The Account SID from your Twilio Account Dashboard.
- `YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: The Auth Token from your Twilio Account Dashboard.

#### Create a Virtual Environment (optional)

Create a virtual Python environment to run the server in isolation and prevent version collisions with other projects. (You can skip this part if you don't mind installing things system-wide.)

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
# (Must be run only once.)
python3 -m venv dg-twilio-ve

# Activate the virtual environment
# (Must be run every time you open a new terminal.)
source dg-twilio-ve/bin/activate
# Your prompt should start with `(dg-twilio-ve)`.

# python3 and pip3 will now run in this virtual environment.
# If you want to deactivate this environment, type `deactivate`.
```

#### Install the Dependencies

In the directory where you downloaded the code, run the following command to
bring in the dependencies needed for this project:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start the Server

Now that you have configured your application and put the dependencies in place, your application
is ready to go! Run it with:

```bash
FLASK_APP=server.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run
```

## Code Walk-through

The application uses Flask to serve a website that generates a phone call to
a phone number you provide. Once the call has concluded, a recording is sent
to the Deepgram API for transcription. Once the transcription has been
returned, the website displays the results.

### Sending Recordings to the Deepgram API

When a call ends, the application calls the `/transcribe/` endpoint, passing a
URL that was provided by Twilio to the call's recording. The server then
sends that URL to Deepgram to transcribe. Once the transcription is complete,
the application returns it to the front-end as a JSON object.

```python
@app.route('/transcribe/', methods=['POST'])
def transcribe() -> dict:
    body = json.loads(request.data)
    print("got request in transcribe:", body)
    print('sending recording to deepgram')
    # Submit the recording to Deepgram
    deepgram_req = requests.post(
        'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true',
        headers={'Authorization': 'token ' + DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
                 "content-type": "application/json"},
        json={"url": body["audio_url"]}
    )
    print('done processing request, sending deepgram response back to client',
          deepgram_req.text)
    return json.loads(deepgram_req.text)
```
