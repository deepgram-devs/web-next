Deepgram’s Named-Entity Recognition (NER) feature recognizes alphanumerics in audio and removes whitespace between the characters in the transcript.

<Alert type="warning">

This feature is available for English only ([all available regions](/documentation/features/language/#enable-feature)).

</Alert>

## Use Cases

Some examples of use cases for NER include:

* Tracking numbers for packages
* Company names that are [initialisms](/documentation/glossary/#I) (for example, IBM)
* Account numbers and customer codes

## Enable Feature

To enable named-entity recognition, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `ner` parameter set to `true` in the query string:

`ner=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<Alert type="info">

Be sure to replace the placeholder `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

By default, Deepgram applies its general AI [model](/api-reference/#model-pr), which is a good, general purpose model for everyday situations. To learn more about the customization possible with Deepgram's API, check out the [Deepgram API Reference](/api-reference/).
