<div class="badge">PRE-RECORDED</div>

Deepgram’s Entity Detection feature identifies and extracts key entities from content in submitted audio and returns these entities in the JSON response. When Entity Detection is enabled, the [Punctuation](/documentation/features/punctuate/) feature will be enabled by default.

## Use Cases

Some examples of uses for Entity Detection include:

- Customers who want to improve Conversational AI and Voice Assistant by triggering particular workflows and responses based on identified name, address, location, and other key entities.
- Customers who want to enhance customer service and user experience by extracting meaningful and relevant information about key entities such as a person, organization, email, and phone number.
- Customers who want to derive meaningful and actionable insights from the audio data based on identified entities in conversations.

## Enable Feature

To enable Entity Detection, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `detect_entities` parameter set to `true` in the query string:

When Entity Detection is enabled, [Punctuation](/documentation/features/punctuate/) will also be enabled by default.

`detect_entities=true&punctuate=true`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

Be sure to replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your Deepgram API Key. You can [create an API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key) in the [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com).

## Analyze Response


When the file is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "transaction_key": "string",
    "request_id": "string",
    "sha256": "string",
    "created": "string",
    "duration": 0,
    "channels": 0
  },
  "results": {
    "channels": [
      {
        "alternatives":[],
      }
    ]
  }
```

Let's look more closely at the `alternatives` object:


```json
"alternatives":[
  {
    "transcript":"Welcome to the Ai show. I'm Scott Stephenson, cofounder of Deepgram...",
    "confidence":0.9816771,
    "words": [...],
    "entities":[
      {
        "label":"MISC",
        "value":" Ai",
        "confidence":0.99699044,
        "start_word":3,
        "end_word":4
      },
      {
        "label":"PER",
        "value":" Scott Stephenson",
        "confidence":0.9999924,
        "start_word":6,
        "end_word":8
      },
      {
        "label":"ORG",
        "value":" Deepgram",
        "confidence":0.9999757,
        "start_word":10,
        "end_word":11
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

In this response, we see that each alternative contains:

- `transcript`: Transcript for the audio being processed.
- `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
- `words`: Object containing each word in the transcript, along with its start time and end time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a confidence value.
- `entities`: Object containing the information about entities for the audio being processed.

And we see that each `entities` object contains:

- `label`: Type of entity identified.
- `value`: Text of entity identified.
- `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates entity reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
- `start_word`: Location of the first character of the first word in the section of audio being inspected for entities.
- `end_word`: Location of the first character of the last word in the section of audio being inspected for entities.

By default, Deepgram applies its Base-tier, general AI model, which is a good, general-purpose model for everyday situations. To learn more about the customization possible with Deepgram's API, check out the [Deepgram API Reference](/api-reference/).
