Deepgram maintains and meets the requirements for multiple data privacy compliance frameworks and certifications. To request Deepgram compliance documentation, talk to your Account Executive.

## SOC 2

Deepgram has achieved SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 certification. An independent auditor has evaluated the security controls and procedures we use to protect the data we process in the cloud and has assessed the operational effectiveness of our systems.

## GDPR

Deepgram is GDPR ready. We provide information to our customers to help them understand how features and functionality of our platform may affect their GDPR compliance obligations.

## HIPAA

Deepgram is considered a Business Associate as defined by the US [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) legislation.

For Deepgram customers who qualify as a Covered Entity under US HIPAA legislation and related legislation and regulations and who provide ePHI (electronic Protected Health Information) to us, Deepgram may qualify as a business associate. We can provide our Business Associate Agreement to such customers upon request.

## CCPA

We are compliant with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which secures privacy rights for California consumers and gives them more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them. You can view [our privacy policy](https://deepgram.com/privacy/) on [our website](https://deepgram.com/).

## PCI

We are PCI compliant, and perform a yearly review of our standing within the framework.
