Our friends over at StepZen have a blog post up about how to use Deepgram, StepZen, and Next.js. In this post, they'll show you how to convert the Deepgram API into your own GraphQL API, translate English audio to French text, and display the results with Next.js.

You can read ["Consuming the Deepgram API: The GraphQL Edit"](https://stepzen.com/blog/consuming-the-deepgram-api-the-graphql-edit) on the StepZen Blog now. If you have any questions about how to use Deepgram or want to learn how to add more features to your Deepgram transcript, please reach out to us on Twitter [@DeepgramDevs](https://twitter.com/DeepgramDevs). Weâ€™re happy to help!
