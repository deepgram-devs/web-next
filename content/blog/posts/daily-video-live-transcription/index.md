[Daily](https://www.daily.co) allows developers to build in video and audio calls into their applications. [Daily recently announced](https://www.daily.co/blog/add-live-transcription-to-a-daily-call-with-our-newest-api/) our partnership which brings accurate live transcriptions to video calls in just a few lines of code.

In their announcement, the team at Daily provide a super useful React.js demo and starter project. Today we're sharing a video tutorial on getting live transcription working, without a framework, in under 40 lines of code (including the HTML boilerplate).

This tutorial covers:

1.  How to set up a Daily video call using Daily Prebuilt.
2.  How to enable live transcriptions for your Daily domain.
3.  How to start transcribing your Daily video calls.
