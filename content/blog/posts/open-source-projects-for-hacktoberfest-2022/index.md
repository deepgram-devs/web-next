It’s my favorite time of the year. That’s right, it’s Hacktober, and our Deepgram DevRel team is ready to go with our Open Source projects! We’re also super excited to share that some of our community members are rolling out their own, Deepgram projects. If you haven’t been down the Hacktoberfest path, don’t worry, we’ll fill you in.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long event devoted to contributing to open-source projects on GitHub or GitLab, presented this year by DigitalOcean, appwrite, and docker. Participants register on the [Hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.com/), and during the month of October must have four pull/merge requests accepted by an open source project that has opted into Hacktoberfest.

## Deepgram’s Open Source Projects

We can’t keep away from this fun! Here are the projects we’re opting into Hacktoberfest.

* [Deepgram Node SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-node-sdk) - Official JavaScript SDK for Deepgram's automated speech recognition APIs.
* [.NET SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk) - .NET SDK for Deepgram's automated speech recognition APIs.
* [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/python-sdk) - Official Python SDK for Deepgram's automated speech recognition APIs.
* [Deepgram Go SDK](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-go-sdk) - Community Go SDK for Deepgram's automated speech recognition APIs.
* [Deepgram Deno SDK](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-deno-sdk) - Community Deno SDK for Deepgram's automated speech recognition APIs
* [Deepgram Rust SDK](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-rust-sdk) - Rust SDK for Deepgram's automated speech recognition APIs.
* [Deepgram Translation Chrome Extension](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/dg-translation-chrome-ext) - A TypeScript chrome extension that uses Deepgram to provide live transcription and translation.



We have a variety of issues, but if you see something that you’d like to contribute, feel free to create an issue or ask a question on our [Community Forum](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/categories/q-a). We’re not the only ones using Deepgram in a Hacktoberfest project though! Check out some of our community members’ projects:



* [Gramcastr](https://github.com/drewclem/gramcstr) from [@DrewClem](https://github.com/drewclem) is a Next.js project that will use Deepgram to generate podcast transcripts and summarize the projects. 
* [Voice To Text Notes](https://github.com/JesseRWeigel/voice-to-text-notes) from [@JesseRWeigel](https://github.com/JesseRWeigel) is a basic speech to text app made with TypeScript that will add features like the ability to save text locally, edit text, and save text to a server. 



We’re super stoked to see what comes out of Hacktoberfest, and we have some fun events planned as well–check out our [Events Category](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/categories/events) to see what Hacktoberfest events we have planned. 



If you have an open source project you’d like to share–even if it doesn’t have anything to do with Deepgram-add it to [our Open Source Project discussion](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/36), so we can amplify what you’re doing!
