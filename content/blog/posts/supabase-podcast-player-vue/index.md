I've previously written two posts on Supabase - the first on getting started with their database, and the second on implementing authentication into your Vue 3 app.

Today, we're building a Vue application which allows users to log in, subscribe to podcast feeds, and create a transcript for any episode with Deepgram.

You can read the post now over on the [freeCodeCamp Blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-podcast-player-with-transcriptions-using-vue-supabase/).

The [final code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/briancbarrow/vue-supabase-auth/tree/final-podcast-feed-transcriptions) if you want to jump straight in.

If you ever have any questions about this post, please feel free to reach out to us on Twitter [@DeepgramDevs](https://twitter.com/DeepgramDevs). Weâ€™re happy to help!
