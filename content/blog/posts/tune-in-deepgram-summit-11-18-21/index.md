Five years ago, as consumer adoption of voice assistants exploded, discussions began about bringing the [power of voice technology to the office](https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/30/amazon-launches-alexa-for-business-platform-bringing-voice-services-to-the-office/). It was an exciting idea-leveraging the ease and convenience of consumer voice assistants in our everyday work lives-yet, in actuality, the real value and power of voice doesn't lie within quick call and response commands. Instead, the benefits of voice technology lie in the rich (and previously untapped) customer insights it can reveal.  Today, with advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), modern speech recognition solutions are able to be utilized for so much more than simple queries-they have the ability to power the next wave of applications and give businesses and vendors a competitive advantage. That's why today, I'm excited to announce our inaugural virtual Deepgram Summit: What's Next in Voice. On November 18, we are bringing together thought leaders from leading enterprises and high-growth startups who are tapping into the power of voice and will provide a glimpse into what the future holds for voice technology. **So, what is next? ** As a former academic researcher, it was my job to never settle for "what works in the moment." We were challenged to constantly ask what's next and to think about how we could improve our techniques and research practices. That's why, as we set out to plan our very first Deepgram Summit, we chose to focus on the future. As an industry we cannot simply rest on what has worked to date in voice, but need to work together to push the envelope and challenge ourselves to leverage voice data to its full potential. It's not enough to settle for what's working now-we want to understand what's working and how we can improve upon it. Deepgram Summit: What's Next in Voice will reveal the power of voice and the possibilities across industries such as retail/ecommerce, healthcare, finance, and even space. We have an incredible lineup of speakers including Zachary DeWitt, partner at Wing Venture Capital, Pete Ellis, chief product officer at Red Box and Joe Wilson, head of product at Volley and many more who will share personal insights into the future of voice technology. Our vision at Deepgram is to empower every organization to unlock critical voice data to better understand employees and customers. Our Deepgram Summit is a natural progression of this vision. During our virtual event, we will not only look at what's working today but also what must be done to deliver on the promise of a voice-enabled tomorrow. Although the event has passed, you can watch on-demand videos from the event at [Deepgram Summit: What's Next in Voice](https://deepgram.com/deepgram-summit-on-demand/).
