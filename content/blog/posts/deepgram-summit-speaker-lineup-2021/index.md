"We're excited to showcase some of the greatest cutting-edge startups and use cases in the voice industry," said Scott Stephenson, CEO and co-founder of Deepgram. "Voice technology has the power to change the way we build and create modern enterprise applications and customer experiences. The future of voice is now, and we're thrilled to host this event to continue meaningful conversations about what's next in voice technology." The summit will cover a wide range of topics and verticals, including the following sessions:

*   **The Resurgence of Voice Technology**: The buzz around voice technology is real-it has the potential to power the next wave of modern applications and give businesses a competitive advantage. But speech technology has historically been a challenging problem for enterprises, one that has languished under legacy tech providers for decades. The pandemic brought this problem to the forefront, with enterprises relying on a heavy volume of video conferencing calls full of team members speaking over each other, background noise, diverse accents, and more. This sudden shift helped businesses realize that audio conversations hold a treasure trove of data and insights that can unlock valuable employee and customer insights. In this opening keynote, Deepgram CEO and co-founder Scott Stephenson will kick off What's Next in Voice-breaking down the resurgence of voice technology with recent innovations and what lies ahead.

*   **Voice is the Next Interface for All Companies:** As the pandemic raced across the U.S., in-person experiences became largely impossible, upending all internal and external business interactions and placing emphasis on touchless interactions. A year and a half later, voice technology, including conferencing platforms and improved call center technology, has emerged as a way for businesses and customers to stay connected and better understand each other through the voice data produced.  During this panel moderated by Dan Miller at Opus Research, Shadi Baqleh, chief operating officer at Deepgram, Craig Akal at Elerian ai, Pete Ellis, chief product officer at Red Box and Venky B, CEO and co-founder at Plivo will discuss the untapped potential hidden within voice data and how to successfully implement voice interfaces moving forward.

*   **Fireside Chat: Using Voice at NASA And Beyond:** As the global leader in space exploration, NASA deploys hundreds of space missions in any given year. During those missions, space-to-ground communication is essential to a mission's success and can be filled with crucial communication insights. In 2020, NASA turned to Deepgram to capture voice data and observations to help inform future missions and problem areas to look out for. In this fireside chat, we will discuss the various ways NASA uses voice technology within the organization, especially as it relates to these critical space missions. We will share a few real-life examples of observations they were able to capture through voice technology and touch on the importance of it for organizations everywhere.

*   **Future of AI and Voice Technology:** Consumers began widely accepting and adopting voice technology in the 2010s with the emergence of Alexa, Google and Siri voice assistance. At the same time, companies began adding voice technology into their company product suite to better support customers and employees. As voice technology has evolved over the past decade, in particular, we are moving past command and response (Siri, Alexa, etc.) into more sophisticated use cases including conversational AI, call intelligence, real-time sales enablement, entertainment, and community safety. This panel discussion will highlight the innovative startups leading this resurgence of voice technology.  During the panel discussion moderated by April Joyner at Business Insider, Joe Wilson, Head of Product at Volley, Terry Chen, Vice President of Audio at Modulate.ai and Zachary DeWitt, Partner at Wing Capital will discuss the important role that voice will play in our future, and the steps they are taking to improve voice for the enterprise.
