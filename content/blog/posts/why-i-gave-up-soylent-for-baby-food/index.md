I recently sought out a PCP (primary care physician) in the Bay Area because I didn't feel very good. I was tired and weak, my lips were chapped, my *wellness was down.*

I registered with an on-demand doctor startup and a few hours later my newly-assigned PCP ubered to my workplace carrying bags of medical equipment. He gave me a checkup in our office on the second floor, where he discovered our corporate stash of soylent products.

# "You need to eat real food"

Although [it has been acknowledged](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/technology/soylent-says-it-will-remake-2-of-its-meal-replacers-after-customers-became-ill.html) that [soylent can make you puke](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13462882/soylent-halts-powder-bar-shipments-making-people-sick), my PCP told me that his real beef with 'lent was more about what it lacked: nutrients and solidity. The nutrients part made sense, and his argument that liquid = bad was that "sugar water rots your teeth". This is a long-term risk.

I've since laid off soylent and my *wellness* is back up. I am one data point. I've relapsed only once (coffiest is so damn good). I might return to the soylent side of life but right now I've got a hot new food obsession.

My new quick chow of choice is baby food. It's safe to eat ([unlike dogfood](http://www.livescience.com/32195-what-happens-if-you-eat-dog-food.html)) and tastes pretty good. You may be imagining grody cans of pale flavorless spinach mush with metallic tang. I agree that nobody should have to eat that. **I'm a snob - I eat baby food only from bags or pouches.** I am constantly discovering vibrant and exciting (and organic) new flavors (this morning I had a Blueberry Banana Flax) and it reminded me of a smoothie I bought once that cost $8.

I love [this treasure trove of creative adult use cases for baby food pouches](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/5-ways-to-use-food-in-a-pouch-161491) including popsicle form:\

I can only assume my new diet is healthier because:

1. baby food contains nutrients
2. My *wellness* is high

Unfortunately I haven't been able to get the opinion of my PCP. This was his goodbye:

![farewell doctor](https://res.cloudinary.com/deepgram/image/upload/v1661725763/blog/why-i-gave-up-soylent-for-baby-food/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-1.28.33-PM.png)

I can only speculate how they lost control of the startup. I hope we don't suffer the same fate with [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/). Doctor, if you're reading this, how did your company get taken over? What do you think of my new diet?

Also please let me know if you're still my PCP.

Pouches up!
