A few weeks ago I spent an evening building a small personal project with a Raspberry Pi and Deepgram - a wearable screen that live captions your voice to help people understand you while wearing a mask. [I tweeted it and it blew up.](https://twitter.com/_phzn/status/1478821408486699009)

Something about a solution to this simple and universal problem made this project get way more popular than I expected, and made me take more time to build additional features.

In this video, I show you how I built this project, along with the parts you need and steps to take to create your own. This project was build with JavaScript, Vue.js, Node.js, Deepgram, and iTranslate. It is hosted for free on Glitch.
