You love to build and learn, and we love to help you do it. That's why the team
at Deepgram has spent the past few months building a new home for our
documentation and API reference. Of course, we couldn't stop there so let me
take a few minutes to highlight what you'll find on the new Deepgram Developer
Platform.

## Documentation

As I mentioned, this is where you'll find the Deepgram API documentation moving
forward. But as we moved, we took time to review each page to ensure it was
up-to-date and accurate so you can get started building fast. There's **much**
more coming in this area. Stay tuned for new content targeting different
learning methods.

## SDKs & Tools

In the new SDKs & Tools area, you will find our official & community-driven
SDKs. You'll also find integrations with 3rd parties like Twilio & Zoom, as well
as accelerators that make it easy to start getting value from the Deepgram API
with little to no code.

## Developer Blog

We're stoked about some of the content we have planned for our new
developer blog. From beginner to advanced, our goal is to help all developers
learn exciting new technologies and level up their skills. In the coming months,
we'll open the ability for you to contribute to our blog and even be compensated
for your work.

## Use Cases

When you're evaluating APIs, it's always easier to make decisions if you can
see examples that illustrate your needs. That's why we're building use cases
with code samples you can take and start running immediately, taking you from
zero to hero with minimal effort.

## Wrap Up

There's a ton of features, content, and more that I can't wait to share, but
for now: Hello world! We're Deepgram and we believe every voice deserves to be
heard and understood.
