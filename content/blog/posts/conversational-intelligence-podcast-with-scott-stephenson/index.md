Our CEO, Scott Stephenson, is featured on the [Smart Route](https://www.calltrackingmetrics.com/blog/resources-o/podcast/introducing-our-new-podcast-series-smart-route/) podcast, where he breaks down the concept of what is "conversation intelligence"-how it works, what kind of value it can add to your organization, and how businesses everywhere can start leveraging this technology to pull insights from their daily conversations with customers and understand, more intimately, what drives them in order to refine their marketing, sales, and service strategy. Thanks to our partner [CallTrackingMetrics](http://www.calltrackingmetrics.com) for inviting us.
