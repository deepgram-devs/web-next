Such annoying (though sometimes funny) errors can be avoided by using a custom speech recognition model designed to understand your particular call data.

### About Mad Libs

[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price in 1952 and released in 1958\. The premise is that players are asked to supply nouns, verbs, adjectives at random which are then filled into blanks. Upon reading, while the words make sense from a grammatical point-of-view, the stories are nonsense.
