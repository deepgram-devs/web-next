## Your one-stop-shop for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) development

We are pleased to announce a new portal to provide a better developer experience. This is your one-stop-shop for all voice engineering and ASR development needs. The new site is located at [developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com/) and is organized into four main sections:

1.  **Get Started** - Overview of Deepgram's technology, processes, and solutions
2.  **Guides** - The heart of the documentation on all the features available for real-time streaming and batch transcription.
3.  **API references** - All the APIs and how to get an API key.
4.  **Security** -  Our stance and guidelines for information security and data privacy.

We will be updating this site regularly to add more information for developers. Please let us know if you would like to see other information or have questions: [support@deepgram.com](mailto:deepgram.comnull). ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/deepgram/image/upload/v1661976834/blog/introducing-the-new-deepgram-developer-portal/developer-screenshot-300x137.jpg)
