Hi! My name is Luke, and I'm happy to announce that I have joined the Developer Relations teams here at Deepgram as a Senior Developer Experience Engineer.

I've been in Developer Relations in one form or another for nearly 5 years. In that time, I've discovered that Developer Relations doesn't really consist of one thing that you can log on and do every day. It is many things that have the ultimate goal of reducing friction to our products, or improving the experience for developers.

I live in the historic Essex town of Colchester, which despite no one having ever heard of it, was Britain's "first city" and the former capital of Roman Britain. There is so much history here, that local residents digging in their garden will often find clay pipes, or other Roman, Norman, and Victorian artifacts. They even found [the UK's only Roman chariot track](https://www.visitcolchester.com/things-to-do/roman-circus-visitor-centre-p1190001) (under my old house!).

The town (then Roman capital) was home to the Roman Temple of Claudius, which the ruined foundations of were later used to build a Norman castle. [Colchester Castle](https://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/content/articles/2006/02/08/colchester_castle_feature.shtml) (pictured) was build almost 1000 years ago, is the largest Norman Keep in Europe, and was also used as a blueprint for the Tower of London.

When not at work you can find me being a dad, tweeting (too much), or playing PC games. I've also recently been [streaming about technology](https://www.twitch.tv/lukeocodes), covering things like Nuxt, Vue, and Tailwind projects. My stream income gets donated to charities like [BlackGirlsCODE](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/) and [GirlsWhoCode](https://girlswhocode.com/), which help under-represented folks gain access to tech careers.
