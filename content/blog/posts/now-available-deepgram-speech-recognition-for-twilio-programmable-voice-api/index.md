Developers love Twilio, and developers love Deepgram. Now they'll love that it’s even easier to unlock the value of post-call recordings through the new Deepgram AI Speech Recognition Add-On in the Twilio Marketplace.

What can developers do with post-call transcription?

*   Add sentiment analysis to every recorded call
*   Identify topic trends by contact center location
*   Analyze discussion points from recruiting and/or sales calls for coaching purposes
*   And much more! Check out some examples [Built with Deepgram.](http://deepgram.com/built-with-deepgram/) 

## Post-Call Transcription Has Extended beyond Contact Center into the Enterprise

For years contact centers have recorded their calls for training and quality assurance purposes, however it wasn’t until the recent past that it was not only possible but economically viable to transcribe 100% of those calls. Call recording is now extending beyond the contact center and support to other departments within an organization such as sales, marketing, and recruiting. Regardless of department, each voice initiative is underway with the goal of either increasing their employee productivity, reducing cost or finding new revenue streams to help them gain a competitive advantage. Call recordings, more than many other touch points with our customers, are rich with information. Beyond understanding correctly what words were said, voice is rich with additional metadata such as the sentiment about the topic at hand.
